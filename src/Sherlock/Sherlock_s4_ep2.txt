SHERLOCK

Still a bit confused about the

daughter’... did seem very real. ‘
And she managed to give me :
information 1 couldn't have :
acquired otherwise. :

JOHN
But she wasn’t ever here.

aa.SHERLOCK
Interesting, isn’t it? 1 have
theorised before that if one vas
able to attenuate to every
available data stream in the world
Simultaneously, it would be
possible to anticipate and deduce
Blmost anything.

o8N
So you dreamed up a magic wonan to
teil you things you didn't’ know?

maRY
Sounds right to me. Possibly I’m
biased.

SHERLOCK

Perhaps the drugs opened certain
doors in my head. I'm intrigued

gouN
I know. Which is why we're all
taking it in turns, keeping you off
the sweeties.

SHERLOCK
I thought we were Just hanging out.

A beat on John - a tight smile, a certain lack of answering

farmth.

gORN
Molly will be here in twenty
minutes.

SHERLOCK

I do think J can last twenty
minutes without supervision:

TORN
Well if you're sure.

John is already setting down his tea.

on Sherlock:

that.

maRY
christ, John, stay, talk.

 

slightly startled that he’s taking him up on

John registers Sherlock's surprise.

JOHN
Sorry, just, you know, Rosie...

SHERLOCK
Of course, Rosie.

maRY

Go and solve a crime together. Make
him wear the hat.

ua.JORN
You'll be Zine for twenty minutes.

SHERLOCK

Yes, yes. Stupid, I wasn't thinking
aboit” Rosie.

gORN
No problem:

SHERLOCK
I should come and see her soon.

gORN
ves.

‘whe “yes” is very flat. Like John just won't engage with the
idea.

maRY
You know, he should wear the hat as
a’special tribute to'me. I'm dead,
I'd'really appreciate it.

John is heading for the door.

Sherlock, clearly desperate to engage, can't seem to get a
conversation started.

SHERLOCK
By the way, that recording may be
inadnissable.

gORN
Sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
It was technically entrapment, so
iE may get kicked out as evidence.
T almost hope it does. I'll upload
ic*te YouTube and everyone will
hear it, He'll be applying to get
into prison.

A smile from Sherlock. No answering emile from John.

JOHN
Well that certainly would be ...
appropriate.

SHERLOCK
He's too famous, you see, everyone
would know who he was, he couldn't
ge anywhere’ he'd get torn apart
fh the street —

JOHN
veah, I get it, I do.

SHERLOCK
are you okay?

 

us.JOEN
No. I'm not okay, I'm never going
to be okay. T think we probably
just have to accept that. Tt is
what it is, and what it ie, is
shit.

Sherlock, defeated. A little nod.
John turns to the door.

mary
John, do better.

A beat, John turns back.

gORN
You didn’t’ kill Mary. Mary died
saving your life. Her choice. No
one made her do it. lo one could
ever make her do anything. Sut the
point is you did aot kill her.

SHERLOCK
In saving my life, she conferred a
value on it. It i$ a currency Ido
Rot know how to spend.

JOHN

i'm fonorrow six £111 ten. See you
‘then.

 

 

SHERLOCK
Looking forward to it.

gORN

He's opening the door to leave, when something happens. A
noise. From Sherlock's phone, lying on the table. A text
Slert noise in the form of an ofgasmic gasp.
John freezes in astonishment.
Sherlock freezes in enbarrassment, a guilty scheol boy.
And Mary is suddenly next to John, amazed.
maRY
oh, that noise. That's a text alert
noise = that’s —

so8N
what was that?

Sherlock now seems to be avoiding his gaze.

ue.SHERLOCK
what was what?

mary
‘That's the text alert of Irene
Adler. The scary, mad one right?

gORN
that noise:

SHERLOCK
What noise?

mary
But she’s dead. oh, but I bet she
isn’t dead, T bet he saved her. For
God sake, the posh boy in love with
the domitatrix’- he's never
knowingly under-cliched, is he?

John, so curious, is approaching Sherlock. Sherlock, back in
his'thair, looks’ up at him, innocently ~ so determined to
Keep his Secret. :

SHERLOCK
ohn?

JORN
i'm going to make a deduction.

 

SHERLOCK
okay. That's good.

oHN
And if my deduction is right,
You're going to be honest, and tell

 

me, okay?
SHERLOCK
Okay, Though I should mention it is +

Harvester now and thea? Are there
nights of passion in High Wycombe?

SHERLOCK

And then John lets rip, yelling.

(Directly to Mary)

I cheated on you, Mary.

(NB This sequence blocked and played so that, Sherlock can
assume that John is talking to'Mary in the abstract, rather
than as someone physically in front of him.)

JORN

a plastic daisy in my hair, Rosie

Beime. That's all it took. A smile.

 

Mary: saying nothing.

Sherlock: saying nothing.

JOHN
We texted. Constantly. You want to
know when? Bvery tine you went out
the room, that’s when. When you
were feeding our child, or stopping
her crying, that’s when.

 

Mary: silence.

Sherlock: silence.

JOHN
qhat’s all it was. Just texting.
But I wanted more. And you know
what. T'still do! I'm not who you

Mary just holds his look for a long moment. And then:

Well, then, John Watson - get the

Sherlock: not suze what to do for a moment. Then he heaves

Sherlock looks at John, comes to a decision. He steps over to
his desk, roots in one of the drawers, He produces hie
deerstalker. Claps it on his head.

SHERLOCK
I'm Sherlock Holmes. I wear the

And out the door he strides. John, bemused for a moment.

Looks around - a figure seems to flick out of sight. Mary?
Was she really here? Did Sherlock hear her too?

Still bemused - but half smiling - John follows Sherlock out.
