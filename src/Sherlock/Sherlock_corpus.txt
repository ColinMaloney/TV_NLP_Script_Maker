I know you like writing about

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

has to be one.

the work of a serial killer?

suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

Obviously this is a frightening
time for people, but all anyone has
to do is exercise reasonable
precautions. We are all as safe as
we want to be.

A moment of frantic scribbling - good quote! - and then a

You've got to stop him doing that.

LESTRADE

You tell me how he does it, I'll

stop him.

Lestrade has slammed into his office, heading straight to his

Closer on Lestrade, about to sit down. Lying on his desk,

Lestrade is stepping through a service door, on the flat
roof. He starts to light the cigarette.

He speaks lightly and casually, knowing there’s someone there
to hear.

LESTRADE
Trying to give these up actually.

I was thinking of a pipe. What do
pipes do for you cigarettes don’t?

A beat - and a cultured voice from off.

Cancer of the jaw.

Lestrade laughs, looks round. A tall, thin man is standing
with his back to us right at the edge of the roof, looking
out over London. A silhouette.

LESTRADE
Okay. What am I getting wrong this
time?

SHERLOCK

No notes. No prior sign. Each of
them in a strange location that
means nothing to them where they’ve
never gone before... That’s not
how I‘d kill myself.

He raises his Cappuccino for a sip, but as he lifts it (in

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

getting cross.

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of

treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

REPORTER

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

getting cross.

we want to be.

at the end.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

REPORTER
Sorry, I 
SALLY
If you've all got texts, please
ignore them.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

REPORTER
It just says “Wrong”

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

18/04/10

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

Close on Sally, reading the signs - Lestrade is
getting cross.

to do is exercise reasonable
precautions. We are all as safe as
we want to be.

How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN

I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an

If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

riding crop. Whack!! Whack!! Whack!!

On Miss. Hooper watching. Perhaps a girlish flutter.
Sherlock appears in shot, tossing the riding crop aside.

MISS. HOOPER
So. Bad day, was it?

Sherlock ignores her little joke, is making notes on a pad.

SHERLOCK
I need to know what bruises form in

SHERLOCK
Are you wearing lipstick? You

You've no idea.

Without glancing up from his computer:
SHERLOCK

MIKE
What’s wrong with the landline?

SHERLOCK
I'd rather text.

Mike has reached inside his jacket -
MIKE
Sorry. Other coat.

Sherlock has swivelled round in his chair -

jacket and is proffering his phone (a rather swish smart
phone - but NOT an iPhone.)

SHERLOCK

Oh, thank you.

This is an old friend of mine John Watson.

Sherlock has barely glanced at John, is now texting away on
his phone.

Coffee! Thank you, Molly! What
happened to the lipstick?

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER
It ... wasn’t working for me.

SHERLOCK

Really? I thought it was a big

She stares at him. He’s still completely oblivious to the
effect he’s having, texting away.

MISS. HOOPER

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each
other.

John, flummoxed - looks to Mike.

JOHN
Oh! You told him about me?

Mike has been watching this with a knowing air. Enjoying the
routine.

MIKE
Not a word.

JOHN

flatmates?

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this
morning, that I was a difficult man
to finda flatmate for. Now he
turns up after lunch with an old
friend Clearly just home from
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn’t a difficult leap.

JOHN
«++ how did you know about
Afghanistan?

But Sherlock isn’t really listening. He’s logging out of the

computer, pulling on his jacket.

SHERLOCK
I’ve got my eye on a nice little
place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

(Heading for the door)

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

JOHN
Is that it?

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site

this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but

A drip is drawn down the centre of the screen, splitting the

Sherlock: early thirties, tall, lean, imperious. He is
plainly but neatly dressed.

Next to him, Miss. Hooper: lab-coated, clearly works here.
MISS. HOOPER
Just in. 67, natural causes. Used
to work here, donated his body. I

Sherlock turns into a hero close-up.

SHERLOCK
Fine. We'll start with the riding

Few minutes later: on Miss. Hooper, watching from the side of
the room. Sherlock’s shadows flap over the wall, huge and
terrifying. He’s slashing at the dissecting table with the
riding crop. Whack!! Whack!! Whack!!

On Miss. Hooper watching. Perhaps a girlish flutter.
Sherlock appears in shot, tossing the riding crop aside.

MISS. HOOPER
So. Bad day, was it?

Sherlock ignores her little joke, is making notes on a pad.

SHERLOCK
I need to know what bruises form in
the next twenty minutes. Text me.

MISS. HOOPER
Listen, I was wondering, maybe
later, when you're finished -
SHERLOCK
Are you wearing lipstick? You
weren't wearing lipstick before.

MISS. HOOPER
I just ... refreshed it a bit.

SHERLOCK
Sorry, you were saying?

MISS. HOOPER
I was wondering if you’d like to

From the other end of the room:

The door opening, voices. Beyond Sherlock we see John and
Mike coming into the room.

JOHN
Bit different from my day.

MIKE
You've no idea.

Without glancing up from his computer:
SHERLOCK
Mike, can I borrow your phone? No
signal on mine.

MIKE
What’s wrong with the landline?

SHERLOCK
I'd rather text.

Mike has reached inside his jacket -
MIKE
Sorry. Other coat.

JOHN

Sherlock has swivelled round in his chair -
=- to see John Watson, who has already reached into his
jacket and is proffering his phone (a rather swish smart
phone - but NOT an iPhone.)

SHERLOCK
(Taking it)
Oh, thank you.
MIKE
This is an old friend of mine John Watson.

Sherlock has barely glanced at John, is now texting away on
his phone.

JOHN

SHERLOCK
Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN

did you -
He's interrupted as Molly Hooper comes through the door,
bearing coffee.

SHERLOCK
Coffee! Thank you, Molly! What
happened to the lipstick?

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER
It ... wasn’t working for me.

SHERLOCK

Really? I thought it was a big
improvement - mouth’s too small
now.

She stares at him. He’s still completely oblivious to the
effect he’s having, texting away.

MISS. HOOPER
ses okay.

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each
other.

John, flummoxed - looks to Mike.

JOHN
Oh! You told him about me?

Mike has been watching this with a knowing air. Enjoying the
routine.

16.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

MIKE
Not a word.

JOHN
.++ then who said anything about
flatmates?

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this
morning, that I was a difficult man
to finda flatmate for. Now he
turns up after lunch with an old
friend Clearly just home from
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn’t a difficult leap.

JOHN
«++ how did you know about
Afghanistan?

18/04/10

But Sherlock isn’t really listening. He’s logging out of the

computer, pulling on his jacket.

SHERLOCK
I’ve got my eye on a nice little
place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

(Heading for the door)

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

JOHN
Is that it?

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I
don’t even know where we’re
meeting!

Sherlock looks at him, a tiny smile - he loves this part.

SHERLOCK
I know you’re an army doctor and
you've been invalided home from
Afghanistan.

SHERLOCK (cont'd)
I know you've got a brother with a
bit of money who's worried about
you, but you won't go to him for
help because you don’t approve of
him - possibly because he’s an
alcoholic, more likely because he
recently walked out on his wife.
And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp is psychosomatic quite correctly, I’m afraid.
That’s enough to be going on with,
don’t you think?

John is staring at him. Utter astonishment. What? What??

Sherlock has turned on his heel, and is walking out the door.

Something slightly dazed and pained in his’eyes. He's been

Looks around the room. A bare minimum of personal

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.
Can't quite grasp that he’s really going to do this —

For a moment, nothing. And under this a voice - tremulous,
tearful.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

Coffee! Thank you, Molly! What

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this

Wasn’t a difficult leap.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

getting cross.

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN

JOHN
You said you could identify a

Yes. And I can read your military

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

Close on Sally, reading the signs - Lestrade is
getting cross.

precautions. We are all as safe as
we want to be.

Mr. Holmes!

He's ringing the doorbell on 221b.

The room is fairly large and pleasant - and a dreadful mess.
Stacks of newspapers, several computers, a tumble of box

collection of what look’like weapons, a skull on the

Well! This could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN
Looked you up on the Internet last

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN
Found your website - The Science of

SHERLOCK

What did you think?

JOHN
You said you could identify a

an airline pilot by his left’ thumb.

SHERLOCK
Yes. And I can read your military

and the drinking habits of your
brother in your mobile phone.

JOHN
How?

Mrs. Hudson has been bustling about, straightening up. She's

picked up a newspaper from the floor.

MRS. HUDSON
What about these suicides, then,
Sherlock? Thought that would be
right up your street. Three of
them, exactly the same. That’s a
bit funny, isn’t it?

there's something different this

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

JOHN
Is that it?

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I
don’t even know where we’re
meeting!

Sherlock looks at him, a tiny smile - he loves this part.

SHERLOCK (cont'd)
I know you've got a brother with a
bit of money who's worried about
you, but you won't go to him for
help because you don’t approve of
him - possibly because he’s an
alcoholic, more likely because he
recently walked out on his wife.
And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp is psychosomatic quite correctly, I’m afraid.
That’s enough to be going on with,
don’t you think?

John is staring at him. Utter astonishment. What? What??

Sherlock has turned on his heel, and is walking out the door.

Mr. Holmes!

Sherlock, please.

He's ringing the doorbell on 221b.

The room is fairly large and pleasant - and a dreadful mess.
Stacks of newspapers, several computers, a tumble of box
files along the shelves, books everywhere, a terrifying
collection of what look’like weapons, a skull on the
mantlepiece. An adjoining kitchen, the table crammed with
testubes and jars and bunsen burners.

Well! This could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.

Mrs. Hudson comes bustling in.

John looks at her, a little affronted.

Oh, Sherlock, the mess you've made.

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN
Looked you up on the Internet last
night.

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN
Found your website - The Science of
Deduction.

SHERLOCK

What did you think?

JOHN
You said you could identify a
software designer by his tie, and
an airline pilot by his left’ thumb.

SHERLOCK
Yes. And I can read your military
career in your face and your leg,
and the drinking habits of your
brother in your mobile phone.

JOHN
How?

Mrs. Hudson has been bustling about, straightening up. She's

picked up a newspaper from the floor.

MRS. HUDSON
What about these suicides, then,
Sherlock? Thought that would be
right up your street. Three of
them, exactly the same. That’s a
bit funny, isn’t it?

On Sherlock, staring, like he’s sensing something in the air.

SHERLOCK

Four. There’s been a fourth. And
there's something different this
time.

MRS. HUDSON
A fourth? How do you know?
For answer, he points to the window.

They look: a blue light is flashing outside - clearly a
police car is parked below.

Feet thumping on the stairs, and suddenly in the doorway -DI Lestrade.

SHERLOCK
Where?

LESTRADE
Brixton. Lauriston Gardens.

SHERLOCK
What's different about this one.
You wouldn't have come to get me,

SHERLOCK
Yeah.

LESTRADE

Sherlock just looks at him. Tempted now, interested.

SHERLOCK

LESTRADE

SHERLOCK
Anderson won't work with me.

LESTRADE
He won't be your assistant.

SHERLOCK
But I need an assistant.

LESTRADE
Will you come?

SHERLOCK
Not in a police car. I'll be right

LESTRADE
Thankyou!

A cursory nod at Mrs. Hudson, and John, and he’s gone.

233A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

John is thunderstruck - a cat at a tennis match. Mrs. Hudson
just looks faintly knowing.

And Sherlock lets a whoop of excitement.

SHERLOCK
Brilliant!

He leaps right over the sofa, dashes to his desk, starts
stuffing things in his pockets - his kit.

SHERLOCK
And I thought it was going to be a
boring evening. Serial suicides,
and now a note ~ oh, it’s
Christmas!

(Dashes for the door)
Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late - might
need some food.

MRS. HUDSON
I’m your landlady, dear, not your
housekeeper.

SHERLOCK

Something cold is fine. John make
yourself at home - have a cuppa!
Don’t wait up!

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

MRS. HUDSON
(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third
“Suicide’ found” there’s a photograph.

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down
type, I can tell. 1/11 make you
that cuppa, you rest your leg.

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

They all took the same poison.

had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -

Apparently you can.

nothing that links them?

but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at

the work of a serial killer?

I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

Sherlock at his laptop, tapping away. On his fingers typing so fast, like a’machine.

From the other end of the room:

The door opening, voices. Beyond Sherlock we see John and
Mike coming into the room.

JOHN
Bit different from my day.

MIKE
You've no idea.

Without glancing up from his computer:
SHERLOCK
Mike, can I borrow your phone? No
signal on mine.

MIKE
What’s wrong with the landline?

SHERLOCK
I'd rather text.

Mike has reached inside his jacket -
MIKE
Sorry. Other coat.

JOHN
Here. Use mine

Sherlock has swivelled round in his chair -
=- to see John Watson, who has already reached into his
jacket and is proffering his phone (a rather swish smart
phone - but NOT an iPhone.)

SHERLOCK
(Taking it)
Oh, thank you.
MIKE
This is an old friend of mine John Watson.

Sherlock has barely glanced at John, is now texting away on
his phone.

SHERLOCK
Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN

SHERLOCK
Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN

did you -
He's interrupted as Molly Hooper comes through the door,
bearing coffee.

SHERLOCK
Coffee! Thank you, Molly! What
happened to the lipstick?

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER
It ... wasn’t working for me.

SHERLOCK

Really? I thought it was a big
improvement - mouth’s too small
now.

She stares at him. He’s still completely oblivious to the
effect he’s having, texting away.

MISS. HOOPER

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each
other.

John, flummoxed - looks to Mike.

JOHN
Oh! You told him about me?

Mike has been watching this with a knowing air. Enjoying the
routine.

16.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

MIKE
Not a word.

JOHN

flatmates?

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this
morning, that I was a difficult man
to finda flatmate for. Now he
turns up after lunch with an old
friend Clearly just home from
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn’t a difficult leap.

JOHN
«++ how did you know about
Afghanistan?

18/04/10

But Sherlock isn’t really listening. He’s logging out of the

computer, pulling on his jacket.

SHERLOCK
I’ve got my eye on a nice little
place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

(Heading for the door)

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I
don’t even know where we’re

bit of money who's worried about
you, but you won't go to him for
help because you don’t approve of
him - possibly because he’s an
alcoholic, more likely because he

And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp is psychosomatic quite correctly, I’m afraid.
That’s enough to be going on with,

Mr. Holmes!

SHERLOCK
Sherlock, please.

JOHN

He's ringing the doorbell on 221b.

The room is fairly large and pleasant - and a dreadful mess.
Stacks of newspapers, several computers, a tumble of box
files along the shelves, books everywhere, a terrifying
collection of what look’like weapons, a skull on the
mantlepiece. An adjoining kitchen, the table crammed with
testubes and jars and bunsen burners.

JOHN
Well! This could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.

SHERLOCK
Yes, I think so. My thoughts

So, this is all -

JOHN

Mrs. Hudson comes bustling in.

MRS. HUDSON
What do you think, Dr. Watson —
there’s another bedroom upstairs.

If you'll be needing two bedrooms

John looks at her, a little affronted.

Well of course we'll be needing

MRS. HUDSON
Oh don’t you worry, all sorts round

Oh, Sherlock, the mess you've made.

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN
Looked you up on the Internet last
night.

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN
Found your website - The Science of
Deduction.

SHERLOCK

What did you think?

JOHN
You said you could identify a
software designer by his tie, and
an airline pilot by his left’ thumb.

SHERLOCK
Yes. And I can read your military
career in your face and your leg,
and the drinking habits of your
brother in your mobile phone.

JOHN
How?

Mrs. Hudson has been bustling about, straightening up. She's

picked up a newspaper from the floor.

MRS. HUDSON
What about these suicides, then,
Sherlock? Thought that would be
right up your street. Three of
them, exactly the same. That’s a
bit funny, isn’t it?

On Sherlock, staring, like he’s sensing something in the air.

SHERLOCK

Four. There’s been a fourth. And
there's something different this
time.

225A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10
MRS. HUDSON
A fourth? How do you know?
For answer, he points to the window.

They look: a blue light is flashing outside - clearly a
police car is parked below.

Feet thumping on the stairs, and suddenly in the doorway -DI Lestrade.

SHERLOCK
Where?

LESTRADE
Brixton. Lauriston Gardens.

SHERLOCK
What's different about this one.
You wouldn't have come to get me,
if there wasn’t something new.

LESTRADE
You know how they never leave
notes?

SHERLOCK
Yeah.

LESTRADE

This one did. Will you come?
Sherlock just looks at him. Tempted now, interested.

SHERLOCK

LESTRADE
Anderson.

SHERLOCK
Anderson won't work with me.

LESTRADE
He won't be your assistant.

SHERLOCK
But I need an assistant.

LESTRADE
Will you come?

SHERLOCK
Not in a police car. I'll be right
behind you.

LESTRADE
Thankyou!

A cursory nod at Mrs. Hudson, and John, and he’s gone.

233A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

John is thunderstruck - a cat at a tennis match. Mrs. Hudson
just looks faintly knowing.

And Sherlock lets a whoop of excitement.

SHERLOCK
Brilliant!

He leaps right over the sofa, dashes to his desk, starts
stuffing things in his pockets - his kit.

SHERLOCK
And I thought it was going to be a
boring evening. Serial suicides,
and now a note ~ oh, it’s
Christmas!

(Dashes for the door)
Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late - might
need some food.

MRS. HUDSON
I’m your landlady, dear, not your
housekeeper.

SHERLOCK

Something cold is fine. John make
yourself at home - have a cuppa!
Don’t wait up!

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

MRS. HUDSON
(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third
“Suicide’ found” there’s a photograph.

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down
type, I can tell. 1/11 make you
that cuppa, you rest your leg.

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

JOHN

I'm sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s just
sometimes’... bloody thing.

Just this once, dear - I’m not your

John is settling down on the sofa - disconsolate, annoyed at
himself.

JOHN
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got them.

MRS. HUDSON

Not your housekeeper.

John, sitting there, frowning: Sherlock Holmes - who the hell
is he?

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

SHERLOCK
(From off)
You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

SHERLOCK

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior

late last night on a building site

investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and

suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

John’s hand, pumping it.

MIKE

MIKE
Bad, is it?

He bites that answer off. Doesn’t want to get into all that.
He raises his Cappuccino for a sip, but as he lifts it (in
his left hand) his hand is shaking’ badly. He's aware that
Mike is staring at it. Just sets it down again. Does NOT
want to get into this.

MIKE
Couldn't Harry help?

John just gives him a look.

JOHN
Yeah, that’s going to happen.

MIKE

For a moment blackness, the zzzziiiippp.

A drip is drawn down the centre of the screen, splitting the
darkness on a thin face staring down at us - Clinical,
fascinated, and from our POV upside down. This is Sherlock
Holmes.

SHERLOCK
How fresh?

Wider. Sherlock stands over a body bag lying on dissection
table. He has just unzipped it to inspect the contents.

Sherlock: early thirties, tall, lean, imperious. He is
plainly but neatly dressed.

Next to him, Miss. Hooper: lab-coated, clearly works here.
MISS. HOOPER
Just in. 67, natural causes. Used
to work here, donated his body. I
knew him. He was nice.

Sherlock turns into a hero close-up.

SHERLOCK
Fine. We'll start with the riding
crop.

Few minutes later: on Miss. Hooper, watching from the side of
the room. Sherlock’s shadows flap over the wall, huge and
terrifying. He’s slashing at the dissecting table with the
riding crop. Whack!! Whack!! Whack!!

On Miss. Hooper watching. Perhaps a girlish flutter.
Sherlock appears in shot, tossing the riding crop aside.

MISS. HOOPER
So. Bad day, was it?

Sherlock ignores her little joke, is making notes on a pad.

SHERLOCK
I need to know what bruises form in
the next twenty minutes. Text me.

MISS. HOOPER
Listen, I was wondering, maybe
later, when you're finished -
SHERLOCK
Are you wearing lipstick? You
weren't wearing lipstick before.

MISS. HOOPER
I just ... refreshed it a bit.

SHERLOCK
Sorry, you were saying?

MISS. HOOPER
I was wondering if you’d like to
have coffee?

SHERLOCK

Black, two sugars, please I'll be

Sherlock at his laptop, tapping away. On his fingers typing so fast, like a’machine.

From the other end of the room:

The door opening, voices. Beyond Sherlock we see John and
Mike coming into the room.

JOHN
Bit different from my day.

MIKE
You've no idea.

Without glancing up from his computer:
SHERLOCK
Mike, can I borrow your phone? No
signal on mine.

MIKE
What’s wrong with the landline?

SHERLOCK
I'd rather text.

Mike has reached inside his jacket -
MIKE
Sorry. Other coat.

JOHN
Here. Use mine

Sherlock has swivelled round in his chair -
=- to see John Watson, who has already reached into his
jacket and is proffering his phone (a rather swish smart
phone - but NOT an iPhone.)

SHERLOCK
(Taking it)
Oh, thank you.
MIKE
This is an old friend of mine John Watson.

Sherlock has barely glanced at John, is now texting away on
his phone.

SHERLOCK
Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN

SHERLOCK
Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN
+. Afghanistan. I’m sorry, how
did you -
He's interrupted as Molly Hooper comes through the door,
bearing coffee.

SHERLOCK
Coffee! Thank you, Molly! What
happened to the lipstick?

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER
It ... wasn’t working for me.

SHERLOCK

Really? I thought it was a big
improvement - mouth’s too small
now.

She stares at him. He’s still completely oblivious to the
effect he’s having, texting away.

MISS. HOOPER
ses okay.

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each
other.

John, flummoxed - looks to Mike.

JOHN
Oh! You told him about me?

Mike has been watching this with a knowing air. Enjoying the
routine.

16.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

MIKE
Not a word.

JOHN
.++ then who said anything about
flatmates?

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this
morning, that I was a difficult man
to finda flatmate for. Now he
turns up after lunch with an old
friend Clearly just home from
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn’t a difficult leap.

JOHN
«++ how did you know about
Afghanistan?

18/04/10

But Sherlock isn’t really listening. He’s logging out of the

computer, pulling on his jacket.

SHERLOCK
I’ve got my eye on a nice little
place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

(Heading for the door)

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

JOHN
Is that it?

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I
don’t even know where we’re
meeting!

Sherlock looks at him, a tiny smile - he loves this part.

SHERLOCK
I know you’re an army doctor and
you've been invalided home from
Afghanistan.

SHERLOCK (cont'd)
I know you've got a brother with a
bit of money who's worried about
you, but you won't go to him for
help because you don’t approve of
him - possibly because he’s an
alcoholic, more likely because he
recently walked out on his wife.
And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp is psychosomatic quite correctly, I’m afraid.
That’s enough to be going on with,
don’t you think?

John is staring at him. Utter astonishment. What? What??

Sherlock has turned on his heel, and is walking out the door.
He turns

SHERLOCK

Hi.

John looks round. Sherlock has just climbed out of a cab,
and is now paying the cabbie.

JOHN
Mr. Holmes!

SHERLOCK
Sherlock, please.

JOHN
Prime spot. Got to be expensive.

He's ringing the doorbell on 221b.

SHERLOCK
Mrs. Hudson, the landlady. she’s
giving me a’ special deal. Owes me
a favour - few years ago, her
husband got himself sentenced to
death in Florida. I was able to
help out.

John gives him on openly skeptical look. Who is this guy?

SHERLOCK

Oh, no. I ensured it.

On the door, as it is opened. John steps into the room,
looking around - Sherlock behind him.

The room is fairly large and pleasant - and a dreadful mess.
Stacks of newspapers, several computers, a tumble of box
files along the shelves, books everywhere, a terrifying
collection of what look’like weapons, a skull on the
mantlepiece. An adjoining kitchen, the table crammed with
testubes and jars and bunsen burners.

JOHN
Well! This could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.

SHERLOCK
Yes, I think so. My thoughts
exactly.

Soon as we get all this So I went ahead and moved in.

They look at each other. Oh!

JOHN
So, this is all -
SHERLOCK
Obviously I can straighten things
up a bit.

JOHN

That’s a skull

SHERLOCK
Friend of mine. Well I say friend

Mrs. Hudson comes bustling in.

MRS. HUDSON
What do you think, Dr. Watson —
there’s another bedroom upstairs.
(Knowing look)
If you'll be needing two bedrooms

John looks at her, a little affronted.

21.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

JOHN
Well of course we'll be needing
two.

MRS. HUDSON
Oh don’t you worry, all sorts round
here. Mrs. Turner next door’s got
married ones.
(Looking around)
Oh, Sherlock, the mess you've made.

18/04/10

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN
Looked you up on the Internet last
night.

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN
Found your website - The Science of
Deduction.

SHERLOCK

What did you think?

JOHN
You said you could identify a
software designer by his tie, and
an airline pilot by his left’ thumb.

SHERLOCK
Yes. And I can read your military
career in your face and your leg,
and the drinking habits of your
brother in your mobile phone.

JOHN
How?

Mrs. Hudson has been bustling about, straightening up. She's

picked up a newspaper from the floor.

MRS. HUDSON
What about these suicides, then,
Sherlock? Thought that would be
right up your street. Three of
them, exactly the same. That’s a
bit funny, isn’t it?

On Sherlock, staring, like he’s sensing something in the air.

SHERLOCK

Four. There’s been a fourth. And
there's something different this
time.

225A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10
MRS. HUDSON
A fourth? How do you know?
For answer, he points to the window.

They look: a blue light is flashing outside - clearly a
police car is parked below.

Feet thumping on the stairs, and suddenly in the doorway -DI Lestrade.

SHERLOCK
Where?

LESTRADE
Brixton. Lauriston Gardens.

SHERLOCK
What's different about this one.
You wouldn't have come to get me,
if there wasn’t something new.

LESTRADE
You know how they never leave
notes?

SHERLOCK
Yeah.

LESTRADE

This one did. Will you come?
Sherlock just looks at him. Tempted now, interested.

SHERLOCK
+++ Who’s on Forensics?

LESTRADE
Anderson.

SHERLOCK
Anderson won't work with me.

LESTRADE
He won't be your assistant.

SHERLOCK
But I need an assistant.

LESTRADE
Will you come?

SHERLOCK
Not in a police car. I'll be right
behind you.

LESTRADE
Thankyou!

A cursory nod at Mrs. Hudson, and John, and he’s gone.

233A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

John is thunderstruck - a cat at a tennis match. Mrs. Hudson
just looks faintly knowing.

And Sherlock lets a whoop of excitement.

SHERLOCK
Brilliant!

He leaps right over the sofa, dashes to his desk, starts
stuffing things in his pockets - his kit.

SHERLOCK
And I thought it was going to be a
boring evening. Serial suicides,
and now a note ~ oh, it’s
Christmas!

(Dashes for the door)
Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late - might
need some food.

MRS. HUDSON
I’m your landlady, dear, not your
housekeeper.

SHERLOCK

Something cold is fine. John make
yourself at home - have a cuppa!
Don’t wait up!

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

MRS. HUDSON
(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third
“Suicide’ found” there’s a photograph.

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down
type, I can tell. 1/11 make you
that cuppa, you rest your leg.

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

JOHN

I'm sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s just
sometimes’... bloody thing.

JOHN:
A cup of tea would be lovely, thank
you.

MRS. HUDSON

(Heading for the door)
Just this once, dear - I’m not your
housekeeper.

John is settling down on the sofa - disconsolate, annoyed at
himself.

JOHN
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got them.

MRS. HUDSON

Not your housekeeper.

John, sitting there, frowning: Sherlock Holmes - who the hell
is he?

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

SHERLOCK
(From off)
You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

SHERLOCK

Seen a lot of injuries then.
Violent deaths?

25.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

JOHN
Well, yes.

SHERLOCK
Bit of trouble too, I bet.

JOHN
Of course, yes. Enough for a
lifetime. Far too much.
They stand facing each other for a moment. Sherlock,
considering. John, not quite knowing what he’s waiting for,
but it’s coming.

SHERLOCK
Want to see some more?

JOHN
(Blurts out of him)
Oh, God, yes!

And he's dashing for the door again --- John hesitates for a second --- and for the first time ever dashes after him.

Something slightly dazed and pained in his’eyes. He's been

He reaches for the pill bottle. His hands are shaking

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

REPORTER
Sorry, I 
SALLY
If you've all got texts, please
ignore them.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

REPORTER
It just says “Wrong”

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

18/04/10

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

Close on Sally, reading the signs - Lestrade is
getting cross.

LESTRADE
(Quick course correction)
Obviously this is a frightening
time for people, but all anyone has
to do is exercise reasonable
precautions. We are all as safe as
we want to be.

A moment of frantic scribbling - good quote! - and then a

Lestrade has slammed into his office, heading straight to his

He speaks lightly and casually, knowing there’s someone there
to hear.

I was thinking of a pipe. What do
pipes do for you cigarettes don’t?

A beat - and a cultured voice from off.

Cancer of the jaw.

Lestrade laughs, looks round. A tall, thin man is standing
with his back to us right at the edge of the roof, looking
out over London. A silhouette.

LESTRADE
Okay. What am I getting wrong this
time?

SHERLOCK

No notes. No prior sign. Each of
them in a strange location that
means nothing to them where they’ve
never gone before... That’s not

On Miss. Hooper watching. Perhaps a girlish flutter.
Sherlock appears in shot, tossing the riding crop aside.

MIKE
What’s wrong with the landline?

SHERLOCK

Sherlock has swivelled round in his chair -

jacket and is proffering his phone (a rather swish smart
phone - but NOT an iPhone.)

SHERLOCK

Oh, thank you.

happened to the lipstick?

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER

SHERLOCK

She stares at him. He’s still completely oblivious to the
effect he’s having, texting away.

MISS. HOOPER

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each
other.

John, flummoxed - looks to Mike.

JOHN
Oh! You told him about me?

Mike has been watching this with a knowing air. Enjoying the
routine.

MIKE
Not a word.

JOHN
.++ then who said anything about
flatmates?

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this
morning, that I was a difficult man
to finda flatmate for. Now he
turns up after lunch with an old
friend Clearly just home from
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn’t a difficult leap.

JOHN
«++ how did you know about
Afghanistan?

But Sherlock isn’t really listening. He’s logging out of the

computer, pulling on his jacket.

SHERLOCK
I’ve got my eye on a nice little
place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

(Heading for the door)

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

JOHN
Is that it?

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I
don’t even know where we’re

John is thunderstruck - a cat at a tennis match. Mrs. Hudson
just looks faintly knowing.

And Sherlock lets a whoop of excitement.

SHERLOCK
Brilliant!

He leaps right over the sofa, dashes to his desk, starts
stuffing things in his pockets - his kit.

SHERLOCK
And I thought it was going to be a
boring evening. Serial suicides,
and now a note ~ oh, it’s

Something cold is fine. John make
yourself at home - have a cuppa!
Don’t wait up!

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

MRS. HUDSON
(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down

apologies.

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

letting his breathing return to normal.

Dr. John Watson. Early thirties, thickset, weathered.
Something slightly dazed and pained in his’eyes. He's been
through hard times, seen bad things.

Looks around the room. A bare minimum of personal
possessions, neatly folded clothes.

The opposite wall. Leaning by the door, a walking cane.

Close on John, looking at it - frowns. Fierce, resentful.

Later - first light. Close on a coffee cup as it is set down
on the desk. Panning down the desk drawer as John pulls it
open, removes a laptop computer -

(whatever gun John would've had in Afghanistan.)

John's look holds on the gun for a moment, like it’s a
curious temptation to him -
-- then he firmly closes the drawer.

The lap top computer open at:

A blog page. Closer on the Page Title:

He reaches for the pill bottle. His hands are shaking
violently he can barely undo the top.

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.
Can't quite grasp that he’s really going to do this —

- and he slams the pill into his mouth, bites down on it.

For a moment, nothing. And under this a voice - tremulous,
tearful.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

REPORTER

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

18/04/10

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

Close on Sally, reading the signs - Lestrade is
getting cross.

to do is exercise reasonable
precautions. We are all as safe as
we want to be.

Lestrade laughs, looks round. A tall, thin man is standing

(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third
“Suicide’ found” there’s a photograph.

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

JOHN

I'm sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s just

JOHN:

MRS. HUDSON

(Heading for the door)
Just this once, dear - I’m not your

John is settling down on the sofa - disconsolate, annoyed at
himself.

JOHN
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got them.

MRS. HUDSON

Not your housekeeper.

John, sitting there, frowning: Sherlock Holmes - who the hell
is he?

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

SHERLOCK
(From off)
You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

SHERLOCK

Seen a lot of injuries then.
Violent deaths?

Well, yes.

SHERLOCK
Bit of trouble too, I bet.

JOHN
Of course, yes. Enough for a

but it’s coming.

SHERLOCK
Want to see some more?

Oh, God, yes!

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

Don't commit suicide.

Hi.

John looks round. Sherlock has just climbed out of a cab,
and is now paying the cabbie.

JOHN
Mr. Holmes!

SHERLOCK
Sherlock, please.

JOHN
Prime spot. Got to be expensive.

He's ringing the doorbell on 221b.

The room is fairly large and pleasant - and a dreadful mess.
Stacks of newspapers, several computers, a tumble of box
files along the shelves, books everywhere, a terrifying
collection of what look’like weapons, a skull on the
mantlepiece. An adjoining kitchen, the table crammed with
testubes and jars and bunsen burners.

JOHN
Well! This could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.

Yes, I think so. My thoughts

Oh, Sherlock, the mess you've made.

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN
Looked you up on the Internet last
night.

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN
Found your website - The Science of
Deduction.

SHERLOCK

What did you think?

JOHN
You said you could identify a
software designer by his tie, and
an airline pilot by his left’ thumb.

SHERLOCK
Yes. And I can read your military
career in your face and your leg,
and the drinking habits of your
brother in your mobile phone.

JOHN
How?

Mrs. Hudson has been bustling about, straightening up. She's

picked up a newspaper from the floor.

MRS. HUDSON
What about these suicides, then,
Sherlock? Thought that would be
right up your street. Three of
them, exactly the same. That’s a
bit funny, isn’t it?

On Sherlock, staring, like he’s sensing something in the air.

SHERLOCK

Four. There’s been a fourth. And
there's something different this
time.

MRS. HUDSON
A fourth? How do you know?
For answer, he points to the window.

They look: a blue light is flashing outside - clearly a
police car is parked below.

Feet thumping on the stairs, and suddenly in the doorway -DI Lestrade.

SHERLOCK
Where?

LESTRADE
Brixton. Lauriston Gardens.

SHERLOCK
What's different about this one.
You wouldn't have come to get me,
if there wasn’t something new.

SHERLOCK
Yeah.

Sherlock just looks at him. Tempted now, interested.

SHERLOCK

SHERLOCK
Anderson won't work with me.

LESTRADE
He won't be your assistant.

SHERLOCK
But I need an assistant.

SHERLOCK
Not in a police car. I'll be right

LESTRADE
Thankyou!

A cursory nod at Mrs. Hudson, and John, and he’s gone.

233A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

John is thunderstruck - a cat at a tennis match. Mrs. Hudson
just looks faintly knowing.

And Sherlock lets a whoop of excitement.

SHERLOCK
Brilliant!

He leaps right over the sofa, dashes to his desk, starts
stuffing things in his pockets - his kit.

SHERLOCK
And I thought it was going to be a
boring evening. Serial suicides,
and now a note ~ oh, it’s
Christmas!

(Dashes for the door)
Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late - might
need some food.

MRS. HUDSON
I’m your landlady, dear, not your
housekeeper.

SHERLOCK

Something cold is fine. John make
yourself at home - have a cuppa!
Don’t wait up!

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

MRS. HUDSON
(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third
“Suicide’ found” there’s a photograph.

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down
type, I can tell. 1/11 make you
that cuppa, you rest your leg.

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

JOHN

I'm sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s just
sometimes’... bloody thing.

JOHN:

MRS. HUDSON

Just this once, dear - I’m not your
housekeeper.

John is settling down on the sofa - disconsolate, annoyed at
himself.

JOHN
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got them.

MRS. HUDSON

Not your housekeeper.

John, sitting there, frowning: Sherlock Holmes - who the hell
is he?

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

SHERLOCK
(From off)
You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

SHERLOCK

Seen a lot of injuries then.
Violent deaths?

JOHN
Well, yes.

SHERLOCK
Bit of trouble too, I bet.

JOHN
Of course, yes. Enough for a

They stand facing each other for a moment. Sherlock,

but it’s coming.

SHERLOCK
Want to see some more?

Oh, God, yes!

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior

late last night on a building site

to hear.

LESTRADE
Trying to give these up actually.

I was thinking of a pipe. What do
pipes do for you cigarettes don’t?

A beat - and a cultured voice from off.

SHERLOCK
(From off)
Cancer of the jaw.

Lestrade laughs, looks round. A tall, thin man is standing
with his back to us right at the edge of the roof, looking
out over London. A silhouette.

LESTRADE
Okay. What am I getting wrong this
time?

SHERLOCK

No notes. No prior sign. Each of
them in a strange location that
means nothing to them where they’ve
never gone before... That’s not
how I‘d kill myself.

On Lestrade. Glances uneasily at the edge of the roof, where
Sherlock is standing.

LESTRADE
++. So. How are you doing these
days?
CUT TO:

On John’s stick and limping leg, as he hobbles along.

John keeps grimly, determinedly on.

We hear a voice is shouting.

MIKE
John!

Watson ignores the voice, limping doggedly on.

MIKE
John Watson!

He turns. A plump, suited man of about Watson’s age grabbing
John’s hand, pumping it.

MIKE
Stamford - Mike Stamford, we were
at Barts together.

JOHN
Yes. Sorry, yes, Mike, hello!

MIKE
Yes, I know, I got fat. I heard you
were abroad somewhere getting shot
at. What happened?

JOHN
I got shot.

EXT. PARK - DAY 17

Mike and John turning from a Cappuccino stand, with their
coffees. (The Criterion Cappuccino Stand.) Mike can’t help
glancing at John’s stick.

MIKE
You okay?

JOHN
Just my leg.

MIKE
Bad, is it?

JOHN
My therapist thinks it’s
psychosomatic.

MIKE

What do you think?

JOHN
I think I got shot.

As they settle at a table...

JOHN
You're still at Barts then?

MIKE
Teaching now - bright young things,
like we used to be. God, I hate
them. What about you? Staying in
town till you get yourself sorted?

JOHN

MIKE
And you couldn't bear to be
anywhere else. Not the John Watson
I know!

JOHN
I’m not the John Watson you -
He bites that answer off. Doesn’t want to get into all that.
He raises his Cappuccino for a sip, but as he lifts it (in
his left hand) his hand is shaking’ badly. He's aware that
Mike is staring at it. Just sets it down again. Does NOT
want to get into this.

MIKE
Couldn't Harry help?

John just gives him a look.

JOHN
Yeah, that’s going to happen.

MIKE
Well I don’t know - get a flatshare
or something?

JOHN
Who'd want me for a flatmate?

Mike gives a little laugh.

JOHN
What?

MIKE
You're the second person to say
that to me today.

John looks at him, intrigued in spite of himself.

JOHN
Who was the first?

INT. ST BARTHOLEMEW'S/DISSECTING ROOMS - DAY 18
For a moment blackness, the zzzziiiippp.

A drip is drawn down the centre of the screen, splitting the
darkness on a thin face staring down at us - Clinical,
fascinated, and from our POV upside down. This is Sherlock
Holmes.

SHERLOCK
How fresh?

Wider. Sherlock stands over a body bag lying on dissection
table. He has just unzipped it to inspect the contents.

Sherlock: early thirties, tall, lean, imperious. He is
plainly but neatly dressed.

Next to him, Miss. Hooper: lab-coated, clearly works here.
MISS. HOOPER
Just in. 67, natural causes. Used
to work here, donated his body. I
knew him. He was nice.

Sherlock turns into a hero close-up.

SHERLOCK
Fine. We'll start with the riding
crop.
cUT TO:
INT. ST BARTHOLEMEW’S/DISSECTING ROOMS - DAY 19

Few minutes later: on Miss. Hooper, watching from the side of
the room. Sherlock’s shadows flap over the wall, huge and
terrifying. He’s slashing at the dissecting table with the
riding crop. Whack!! Whack!! Whack!!

On Miss. Hooper watching. Perhaps a girlish flutter.
Sherlock appears in shot, tossing the riding crop aside.

MISS. HOOPER
So. Bad day, was it?

Sherlock ignores her little joke, is making notes on a pad.

SHERLOCK
I need to know what bruises form in
the next twenty minutes. Text me.

MISS. HOOPER
Listen, I was wondering, maybe
later, when you're finished -
SHERLOCK
Are you wearing lipstick? You
weren't wearing lipstick before.

MISS. HOOPER
I just ... refreshed it a bit.

SHERLOCK
Sorry, you were saying?

MISS. HOOPER
I was wondering if you’d like to
have coffee?

SHERLOCK

Black, two sugars, please I'll be
upstairs.

Sherlock at his laptop, tapping away. On his fingers typing so fast, like a’machine.

From the other end of the room:

The door opening, voices. Beyond Sherlock we see John and
Mike coming into the room.

JOHN
Bit different from my day.

MIKE
You've no idea.

Without glancing up from his computer:
SHERLOCK
Mike, can I borrow your phone? No
signal on mine.

MIKE
What’s wrong with the landline?

SHERLOCK
I'd rather text.

Mike has reached inside his jacket -
MIKE
Sorry. Other coat.

JOHN
Here. Use mine

Sherlock has swivelled round in his chair -
=- to see John Watson, who has already reached into his
jacket and is proffering his phone (a rather swish smart
phone - but NOT an iPhone.)

SHERLOCK
(Taking it)
Oh, thank you.
MIKE
This is an old friend of mine John Watson.

Sherlock has barely glanced at John, is now texting away on
his phone.

15.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

SHERLOCK
Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN
se. I'm sorry?

SHERLOCK
Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN
+. Afghanistan. I’m sorry, how
did you -
He's interrupted as Molly Hooper comes through the door,
bearing coffee.

SHERLOCK
Coffee! Thank you, Molly! What
happened to the lipstick?

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER
It ... wasn’t working for me.

SHERLOCK

Really? I thought it was a big
improvement - mouth’s too small
now.

She stares at him. He’s still completely oblivious to the
effect he’s having, texting away.

MISS. HOOPER
ses okay.

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each
other.

John, flummoxed - looks to Mike.

JOHN
Oh! You told him about me?

Mike has been watching this with a knowing air. Enjoying the
routine.

16.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

MIKE
Not a word.

JOHN
.++ then who said anything about
flatmates?

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this
morning, that I was a difficult man
to finda flatmate for. Now he
turns up after lunch with an old
friend Clearly just home from
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn’t a difficult leap.

JOHN
«++ how did you know about
Afghanistan?

18/04/10

But Sherlock isn’t really listening. He’s logging out of the

computer, pulling on his jacket.

SHERLOCK
I’ve got my eye on a nice little
place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

(Heading for the door)

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

JOHN
Is that it?

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I
don’t even know where we’re
meeting!

Sherlock looks at him, a tiny smile - he loves this part.

SHERLOCK
I know you’re an army doctor and
you've been invalided home from
Afghanistan.

SHERLOCK (cont'd)
I know you've got a brother with a
bit of money who's worried about
you, but you won't go to him for
help because you don’t approve of
him - possibly because he’s an
alcoholic, more likely because he
recently walked out on his wife.
And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp is psychosomatic quite correctly, I’m afraid.
That’s enough to be going on with,
don’t you think?

John is staring at him. Utter astonishment. What? What??

Sherlock has turned on his heel, and is walking out the door.
He turns

SHERLOCK
The name's Sherlock Holmes and the
address is 221b Baker Street.
Afternoon.

He goes.

Hi.

John looks round. Sherlock has just climbed out of a cab,
and is now paying the cabbie.

JOHN
Mr. Holmes!

SHERLOCK
Sherlock, please.

JOHN
Prime spot. Got to be expensive.

He's ringing the doorbell on 221b.

SHERLOCK
Mrs. Hudson, the landlady. she’s
giving me a’ special deal. Owes me
a favour - few years ago, her
husband got himself sentenced to
death in Florida. I was able to
help out.

John gives him on openly skeptical look. Who is this guy?

JOHN
You stopped her husband being
executed.

SHERLOCK

Oh, no. I ensured it.

Joyously she throws her arms rounds Sherlock.

INT. 221B BAKER STREET/SITTING ROOM - DAY 28

On the door, as it is opened. John steps into the room,
looking around - Sherlock behind him.

The room is fairly large and pleasant - and a dreadful mess.
Stacks of newspapers, several computers, a tumble of box
files along the shelves, books everywhere, a terrifying
collection of what look’like weapons, a skull on the
mantlepiece. An adjoining kitchen, the table crammed with
testubes and jars and bunsen burners.

JOHN
Well! This could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.

SHERLOCK
Yes, I think so. My thoughts
exactly.
JOHN SHERLOCK
Soon as we get all this So I went ahead and moved in.

rubbish cleaned out.

They look at each other. Oh!

JOHN
So, this is all -
SHERLOCK
Obviously I can straighten things
up a bit.

JOHN

That’s a skull

SHERLOCK
Friend of mine. Well I say friend

Mrs. Hudson comes bustling in.

MRS. HUDSON
What do you think, Dr. Watson —
there’s another bedroom upstairs.
(Knowing look)
If you'll be needing two bedrooms

John looks at her, a little affronted.

21.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

JOHN
Well of course we'll be needing
two.

MRS. HUDSON
Oh don’t you worry, all sorts round
here. Mrs. Turner next door’s got
married ones.
(Looking around)
Oh, Sherlock, the mess you've made.

18/04/10

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN
Looked you up on the Internet last
night.

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN
Found your website - The Science of
Deduction.

SHERLOCK

What did you think?

JOHN
You said you could identify a
software designer by his tie, and
an airline pilot by his left’ thumb.

SHERLOCK
Yes. And I can read your military
career in your face and your leg,
and the drinking habits of your
brother in your mobile phone.

JOHN
How?

Mrs. Hudson has been bustling about, straightening up. She's

picked up a newspaper from the floor.

MRS. HUDSON
What about these suicides, then,
Sherlock? Thought that would be
right up your street. Three of
them, exactly the same. That’s a
bit funny, isn’t it?

On Sherlock, staring, like he’s sensing something in the air.

SHERLOCK

Four. There’s been a fourth. And
there's something different this
time.

225A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10
MRS. HUDSON
A fourth? How do you know?
For answer, he points to the window.

They look: a blue light is flashing outside - clearly a
police car is parked below.

Feet thumping on the stairs, and suddenly in the doorway -DI Lestrade.

SHERLOCK
Where?

LESTRADE
Brixton. Lauriston Gardens.

SHERLOCK
What's different about this one.
You wouldn't have come to get me,
if there wasn’t something new.

LESTRADE
You know how they never leave
notes?

SHERLOCK
Yeah.

LESTRADE

This one did. Will you come?
Sherlock just looks at him. Tempted now, interested.

SHERLOCK
+++ Who’s on Forensics?

LESTRADE
Anderson.

SHERLOCK
Anderson won't work with me.

LESTRADE
He won't be your assistant.

SHERLOCK
But I need an assistant.

LESTRADE
Will you come?

SHERLOCK
Not in a police car. I'll be right
behind you.

LESTRADE
Thankyou!

A cursory nod at Mrs. Hudson, and John, and he’s gone.

233A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

John is thunderstruck - a cat at a tennis match. Mrs. Hudson
just looks faintly knowing.

And Sherlock lets a whoop of excitement.

SHERLOCK
Brilliant!

He leaps right over the sofa, dashes to his desk, starts
stuffing things in his pockets - his kit.

SHERLOCK
And I thought it was going to be a
boring evening. Serial suicides,
and now a note ~ oh, it’s
Christmas!

(Dashes for the door)
Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late - might
need some food.

MRS. HUDSON
I’m your landlady, dear, not your
housekeeper.

SHERLOCK

Something cold is fine. John make
yourself at home - have a cuppa!
Don’t wait up!

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

MRS. HUDSON
(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third
“Suicide’ found” there’s a photograph.

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down
type, I can tell. 1/11 make you
that cuppa, you rest your leg.

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

JOHN

I'm sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s just
sometimes’... bloody thing.

24.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

MRS. HUDSON
I understand, dear. I've got a
hip.

JOHN:
A cup of tea would be lovely, thank
you.

MRS. HUDSON

(Heading for the door)
Just this once, dear - I’m not your
housekeeper.

John is settling down on the sofa - disconsolate, annoyed at
himself.

JOHN
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got them.

MRS. HUDSON

Not your housekeeper.

John, sitting there, frowning: Sherlock Holmes - who the hell
is he?

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

SHERLOCK
(From off)
You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

SHERLOCK

Seen a lot of injuries then.
Violent deaths?

25.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

JOHN
Well, yes.

SHERLOCK
Bit of trouble too, I bet.

JOHN
Of course, yes. Enough for a
lifetime. Far too much.
They stand facing each other for a moment. Sherlock,
considering. John, not quite knowing what he’s waiting for,
but it’s coming.

SHERLOCK
Want to see some more?

JOHN
(Blurts out of him)
Oh, God, yes!

SHERLOCK
Get your coat.

And he's dashing for the door again --- John hesitates for a second --- and for the first time ever dashes after him.

JOHN
What does that mean?

SHERLOCK
It means when the police are out of
their depth - which is always they consult me.

JOHN
But the police don’t consult -
Bites off the word. Sherlock looks sharply at him.

JOHN
Amateurs.

Just the merest flash in Sherlock’s eyes: didn’t like that.

SHERLOCK
When I first met you yesterday I
said, Afghanistan or Iraq? You
seemed surprised.

JOHN
How did you know?

And whoosh!

SHERLOCK

Your limp is really bad when you
walk, but you don’t ask for a chair
when you stand, like you've
forgotten about it - so it’s at
least partly psychosomatic. That
says the circumstances of the
original injury were traumatising wounded in action then.

In the cab:

JOHN
You said I had a therapist.

letting his breathing return to normal.

Dr. John Watson. Early thirties, thickset, weathered.
Something slightly dazed and pained in his’eyes. He's been
through hard times, seen bad things.

Looks around the room. A bare minimum of personal
possessions, neatly folded clothes.

The opposite wall. Leaning by the door, a walking cane.

Close on John, looking at it - frowns. Fierce, resentful.

He reaches for the pill bottle. His hands are shaking
violently he can barely undo the top.

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.
Can't quite grasp that he’s really going to do this —

- and he slams the pill into his mouth, bites down on it.

For a moment, nothing. And under this a voice - tremulous,
tearful.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

Close on Sally, reading the signs - Lestrade is
getting cross.

we want to be.

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

Oh, look at him, dashing about? My

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third

A silence as John and Sherlock look at each other. John
Spreads his hands a questioning gesture, what the hell is

Sherlock: shrugs back. Search me.

John comes in to the room, sits on the other end of the sofa.
Another silence.

SHERLOCK

The thought almost quells the laughter for a second. And then
the door opens, and MYCROFT steps in.

SHERLOCK
Apparently, yes.

And this childish jokes sets them off again, roaring with
laughter.

Hugely annoyed. Mycroft bangs shut the door.

MycROFT
Just once, could you two behave like
grown-ups.

JOHN
We solve crimes, 1 blog about it, and

glanced at the police report ~ bit
obvious, surely.

SHERLOCK

SHERLOCK
Not, to date, anyone with a navy.

MYCROFT
This is a matter of the highest
security, and therefore of trust.

Naturally not. They all spy on people

‘THE EQUERRY
I did wonder myself, Mycroft.

brakes jan on in his brain as he just stares.a7.

naked. (NB. This shot for pre-watershed. We know she is naked
but we don't see anything. Like Sherlock, we always manage to
avert our eyes.)

Irene is just smiling at him now.

Irene Adler, I presume.

on Sherlock: on the back foot for once. And now she's running
a finger along one of his cheekbones.

Look at these cheekbones. I think I
coula cut my hand slapping your face.
Would you like me to try?

With an impish smile, she pops the clerical collar in her
mouth, snapping her teeth shut on it.

Right then, so...

And he stops dead at what he sees: Sherlock, fact to face
with a naked wonan, who has his clerical collar in her teeth.

JORN
okay. Missed something, did 1?

 

Irene just smiles. Without a care in the world, she heads
over to the other sofa, settles down on it. (Perhaps she
picks up a cushion at this point - just to make the scene
Shootable.)

IRENE ADLER

tea, I'11 call the maid.

IRENE ADLER

Did he take sugar?

On Sherlock - something troubling him.

Sherlock's POV. On Irene, just sitting there. As he glances
over to John we see the normal swirl of words round him (TWO

Blinks again. Nothing.

IRENE ADLER

Do you know the big problem with
disguise, Mr. Holmes? However hard
you try, it's always a self-portrait.

face?

IRENE ADLER

I think you're damaged, delusional,
and believe in a higher power —
though in your case, it's yourself.
And somebody loves you.

Now SHERLOCK walks past Phil (in reality, still swanning
about Irene's room talking to her, but visually now walking
among the flashback. )

SHERLOCK
Getting nowhere.

WHIP PAN Ti

 

over at with HIKER, also frozen. He's standing, seemingly
staring at the sky

SHERLOCK
(v.02)

And the hiker is taking a moment.

Looking at the sky. Watching the

birds?

And SHERLOCK steps from behind FROZEN HIKER. (Again still
Feally swanning about Irene's room, but stitched into the
flashback. )

SHERLOCK
Any moment now something's going to
happen. What?

We cut to Trene, still sitting on the sofa - but now the sofa
is SITING IN THE THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD. Beyond her, we
can see Phil in the car.

 

 

IRENE ADLER
The hiker's going to die.
SHERLOCK
No. that's the result. What's going
to happen.
IRENE ADLER
E don't understand.
SHERLOCK
Try to.
IRENE ADLER
why?
SHERLOCK

Because your job is ridiculous.
Because you cater to the whims of the
pathetic and take your clothes off to
make an impression. Stop boring me
and think. It's the new sexy.a3.

on Irene - those words landing like slaps. Regroups.

IRENE ADLER
the car's going to backfire.

 

SHERLOCK
There's going to be loud noise.

IRENE ADLER
So what?

SHERLOCK
oh, noises are important. Noises can
tell you everything. For instance
And the beep-beep-beep-beep-beep. The shrill of smoke alarm.
Super fast zoom on Sherlock's eyes. Stylised slow-motion, as
they swivel to look at Irene with @ big, slamming sound
effect.

on Irene: stylised slow motion as the turns her to look at ~ big slamming sound effect ~

= an ornate mirror on the wall.

SHERLOCK
Thank you

Sherlock start striding towards the mirror.

SHERLOCK
A mother, hearing a smoke alarm,
would look towards her child ...

He slides the mirror to one side, revealing a safe built into
the wall, with a keypad on it.

SHERLOCK
I really hope you don't have a baby
in here.

(calle off)
vou can turn it off, John.

IND. HALLWAY OF IRENE'S HOUSE ~ DAY

 

John is standing in the hallway - has the magazine held aloft
Like a toreh, one end lit and emoking right under a smoke
alarm.

He now beats against the wall, putting it out.
SHERLOCK

(welling from)
x said turn it off.44.
JOHN
Well give me a momentAnd then, from off- a calm American voice
NEILSON
Excuse me~

John looks round.
Three men standing in the hallway now. Big, black suite,
square-jawed — traditional men in black, NEILSON, Tranter,
ARCHER.

NEILSON
Let me take care of that for you.

And Neilson draws a gun with silence from under his jacket,
ains it at the alarm, and shoots it. It falls silent.

ORN
‘thanks.

 

IND, IRENE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Sherlock, examining the keypad.

SHERLOCK
You should use a glove on these
things, you know ~ ever seen the
state of an iPad screen? Now the
heaviest 011 deposit is always on the
first key used- that's clearly a3 ~
but the sequence is almost impossible
to read after that. 1 know from the
make it's a six digit code, and it
can't be your birthday - nd
Gisrespect, but you were clearly born
in the 80s’and the eight is barely
used so —

IRENE ADLER
I'd tell you the code right now - but
you know what?

He looks at her.

IRENE ADLER
I already have.

on Sherlock - frowns - What?

IRENE ADLER
hink.45.

And now the door is bursting open. John is being shoved into
the room, slammed down to his knees - Archer takes John,
Tranter takes Irene, Neilson walks among them, barking
orders.

NEILSON
Hands behind your head, on the floor,
keep it still!

JOHN
Sorry, Sherlock.

NEILSON
Miss Adler, on the floor!

Archer stays behind John, gun leveled at his head. The other
two men move swiftly into the room - Neilson has his gun on
Sherlock.

Neilson has his gun on Sherlock.

on Sherlock, staring down the barrel, cool as ever.

 

SHERLOCK
don't you want me on the floor
too?
NEILSON
No, sir - I want you to open the
sate.
SHERLOCK
American. Interesting. Why would you
NEILSON

Sir, the safe, now please.

SHERLOCK
I don't know the code.

NEILSON
(Touches his ear)
We've been listening. she said she

told you.
SHERLOCK

If you've been listening, you know

she didn't.

He raises his gun slightly, so it's pointing directly at
Sherlock's forehead.

NEILSON
I'm assuming I missed something from your reputation, I'm assuming
you didn't - Kr. Holmes.46.

ORM
For God's sake, she’s the one who
knows ~ ask her! ?

NEILSON
Yes, sir. She also knows the code
that automatically calls the police,
or sets off the burglar alarm - I've
Tearned not to trust this woman.

IRENE ADLER
Me. Holmes~

NEILSON
Shut up! one word out of you, just
one, I will decorate that wail with
the insides of your head. This, for
me, will not be hardship.

Irene falls silent - looks to Sherlock. Something intense in
her gaze, like she's trying to communicate something.

NEILSON
Me. Archer, at the count of three,
shoot br. Katson.

JOHN

oh, for God's sake, what7?
SHERLOCK

I don't know the code.
NEILSON

one.
SHERLOCK

I don't know the code!
NEILSON

wo.
SHERLOCK

She didn't tell me, I don't know iti!
NEILSON

I'm prepared to believe you ~ any

second now. Three!

SHERLOCK
Mo, stop!!

And he's got it! The lights go on in his head.

He spins to the keypad. His hand over it now. Cutting fast
round —

Sherlock's face: is he right? Irene's face: fascinated!47.

John's face: oh shit!

 

And now Sherlock is punching in a code - six rapid beeps. And
the safe chimes. And the LED dieplay reads OPEN.

on Sherlock sags. So close.

 

on John: oh dear God! But keeping it together.
NEILSON
‘Thank you, Mr. Holmes. open it,

please.
Now, very fast ~ Sherlock glances to Irene = Irene, stricken-faced - tiniest shake of her head 
= Sherlock, a frown, a flicker of thought, gets it - now
reaching for safe door ~

SHERLOCK
vatican cameos!

on John, hearing that, recognising the words ~ what?
Now, stylised show motion
= Sherlock slams open the safe door ~

in the same moment, he starts to duck = close on the interior of the safe, as the door opens 
= a handgun (also with silencer) mounted on a little tripod,
pointing out. A cable runs from the door, through hooke or
hoops, arranged so that the cable runs right over the trigger

= the action of the opening door, now tightening the cable
over the trigger —

= closer on the silenced muzzle as the bullet explodes from
the end —

= archer, standing behind the still kneeling John, is the
direct line of fire~

~ he starts to crumple 
= on Neilson, turning in shock - and Sherlock is already
cannoning into him —

zon Irene. She's still kneeling in front of Tranter, who
stands behind her, gun at her head ~

=_and now she's throwing punch backwards over her shoulder,
right into the man's groin48.

he starts to crumple 
= on John, leaping to retrieve the gun from Archer as he
falls —

Normal speed.

Sherlock has grabbed Neilson’s gun, now has it trained on
Neilson who is sprawled on the floor in front of him.

Similarly, Irene has Tranter’s gun aimed at him, as he's
Soublea up, fetching on the floor.

John is checking Archer.

JOHN
okay. He's dead.

 

They all look at each other. What do they do now?

Sherlock steps smartly over Neilson, clubs him from behind
with the gun butt. He falls limps.

SHERLOCK
(fo IRENE)
Would you mind?

IRENE ADLER
Not at all.

She moves to do the same to Archer. As che does so, Sherlock
glances towards the safe - there's a little leopard skin
object in there.

Thump! Archer hits the floor.

SHERLOCK
‘Thank you.

IRENE ADLER
Thank you ~ you're very
observant.

 

ORM
observant?

IRENE ADLER
i'm flattered.

SHERLOCK
(Striding from the room)
Don't be.

ORM
Flattered? Sorry, what?

He's following Sherlock from the room.49.

INT, HALLWAY OF IRENE'S HOUSE ~ DAY

 

Sherlock is striding for the front door.

SHERLOCK
There must he more of them - they'11
have back-up watching the house.

ORN
We should call the police.

SHERLOCK
ves.

Sherlock has opened the door. In one motion he yanks the
Silencer off the gun, and fires up into the sky. Slam! Blam!
Blam! Blan! Blam!

SHERLOCK
on their way.

ORN
oh, for God's sake.

SHERLOCK
Shut up, it's quick. Check the rest
of the house, see how they got in.

IND, IRENE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
IRENE is at the safe, looking inside for something.

SHERLOCK

(From off)
Well that’s the Knighthood in the

bag.

She spins. SHERLOCK, leaning in the doorway. He tosses
something in his hand.

Closer on it. A phone with a built in camera, blackberrystyle, but funkier. A leopard skin cover, a fetishists phone,
Something we'd instantly recognise.

IRENE ADLER
what's mine.

SHERLOCK
I take it they're all on here? The
photographs.

He presses 2 button.

Close on the screen ~50.

LOCKED

Four boxes appear in the centre of the screen, for the number
to be typed, so that it now appears

1AM

cacaeiey
LOCKED

IRENE ADLER
I have other copies, of course.

SHERLOCK
No, you don't. You'll have
permanently disabled any kind of
Connection or uplink ~ unless the
contents of this phone are provably
unigue, you wouldn't be able to sell
them.

IRENE. ADLER
Who says I'm selling?

SHERLOCK

(Looking at the three prone men)
But why are they interested?
Whatever's on here, it's more than
just photographs

 

A cold stare from Irene. No flirtatiousness now, deadly

IRENE ADLER
It's my life, Mr. Holmes. My
protection.

SHERLOCK
qt was.

He tosses the phone in his hand again.
JORN
(Calling from)
Sherlock!

Sherlock heads away.

 

Irene: that cold stare for a moment - then starts to follow.

IND, IRENE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Irene's spectacular bedroom. The TALL WINDOWS stand open ~
JOHN is kneeling by Kate who's sprawled on the floor,si.

JORN
Mast have come in this way.

SHERLOCK
clearly.

IRENE is coming into the room now.

JOHN
She's okay, just out cold.

IRENE ADLER
Well God knows, she's used to that.
There's a back’ door ~ better check
it, Dr. Watson.

And she goes straight to her bedside table, rooting about in
it for something.

Sherlock and John exhange a glance. Blimey, she's cold.
Sherlock gives John a ned.

JOHN
sure.

John heads out.
SHERLOCK
You're very calm - your booby trap
just killed 2 man.
IRENE ADLER
Well he'd have killed me - it was
self-defence in advance.
And she turns with what's she taken from bedside cabinet ~

+ and slams 2 hypodermic into his arm. Sherlock shoots to his
feet.

SHERLOCK
What?? What have you - 77

He's reeling now, trying to grab the hypo from his arm. Irene
slaps him hard across the face.

IRENE ADLER
Give it to me.

He staggers against the wall - tries to get away from her.
She steps calmly forward, slaps him hard again.

IRENE ADLER
Now! Give it to me!

He reels avay from her, but clinging to consciousness,
gripping on to that damn cameraphone.52.

SHERLOCK
No!

IRENE ADLER
oh, for goodness sake!

She snatches up her riding crop from the bedside table - now
slashes at him, calm and expert. More lion-tamer, than
sadist.

IRENE ADLER
Drop it.

(slashes)
I said, drop iti

She cracks him across the back of the hand. He drops the
camera-phone, with a cry.

She kneels by him, picks up the camera phone, smiles.

IRENE ADLER
Thankyou, dear. Now tell that sweet
Little posh thing, the pictures are
safe with me. They're not for
Blackmail, just insurance. Besides ~
might want to see her again.

He makes a flailing grab for the camera-phone - she easily
avoids.

IRENE ADLER
No, no - it's been a pleasure, don't
spoil it.
(fickle him under the chin with her
crop)
This is how I want you to remember
me - the woman who beat you. Good
night, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

‘JOHN
Jesus!

John has just come back through the door, staring now.

JOHN
What are you doing?

Irene is already stepping to the window, starting to climb
out.

IRENE ADLER
He'll sleep for a few hours. Make
Sure he doesn't choke on his own
vonit, it makes for a very
unattractive corpse.

John, now finding the hypodermic -53.

ORM

What is this, what did you give him.
Sherlock??

IRENE ADLER
He'll be fine, I've used it an loads
of my friends.

‘JORN
Sherlock, can you hear me?

Irene, about to climb out the window, turns back for a
moment, contemplating Sherlock. He's still grimly clinging to
consciously, trying to sit up, fighting for breath.

IRENE ADLER
You know, I was wrong about him. He
did know where to look.

JORN
For what? What are you talking about?

IRENE ADLER
whe keycode to my safe.

JOHN
What was it?

IRENE ADLER
(fo Sherlock)
shall 1 tell him?
(A best - smiles at John)
My measurements

on John - obi
on Sherlock, losing the fight - he flops back on the floor.
we hold on him a moment, and then:

And then (a bit like with Phil the driver earlier) the camera

spins on its axis, as if turning Sherlock upright again and

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD ~ DAY

 

= this time it's SHERLOCK, mot Phil, sitting at the wheel. He
looks a little dazed, confused. The’ image is slightly,
twisted, distorted ~ dreamy.

And where Sherlock swanned past last time, this time it's
IRENE.

IRENE ADLER
Got it!sa.

Sherlock blinks confusedly at her.

IRENE ADLER
shh, now, don't get up. I'11 do the
talking. So the car's about to backfire vs. and the hiker...

She looks to the HIKER. We whip pan to:

The frozen HIKER, staring at the sky. We widen the shot to
include

SHERLOCK and IRENE, standing a few feet from him, observers
only. (Sherlock in’his normal suit, Irene now in Sherlock's
coat.)

IRENE ADLER

. ig staring at the sky. You said he
Gould be watching the birds ~ but he
wasn't, was he? He was watching
another kind of flying thing.

Bang!
IRENE ADLER
The car back-fires, the hiker turns
£0 Look.

The Hiker turn to look behind him .

 

Now from the POV of something flying through the air, superfast, towards the Hiker. We go slaming right into the back
of the Hiker's head, and the screen goes biack.

IRENE ADLER
Which was his big mistake ...

on Phil looking out his car, to see: Phil's POV. The Hiker
now lying dead.

IRENE ADLER
ay the tine the driver looks up, the
hiker is already dead. What he
doesn't see is what Killed him because it's fallen in the stream.

Shot from above the stream, bubbling along.

IRENE ADLER
(From off)

An accomplished sportsman recently

returned from foreign travel - with 2

boomerang.

And there, floating downstream, is a blood-stained boomerang.
We pan up'to see Sherlock and irene watching it float away.55.

IRENE ADLER
You got all that from one look.
Definitely the new sexy.

SHERLOCK
1 don't

 

Closer on Irene ~ now more stylised, she’s surrounded by
darkness.

IRENE ADLER

Bush now, it's okay.
(Kissing his check)

i'm only returning your coat.

IND. SHERLOCK'S BEDROOM ~ NIGHT
on Sherlock startling awake!
Where is he?? In his bed! How the hell did he get here??

SHERLOCK
Jobn! John!

He's trying to climb out of bed now, so unsteady on his feet,
‘drunken.

The door is opening, John is there.

JOHN
vou okay?

SHERLOCK
How did 1 get here?

JORN
I don't suppose you remember much,
you weren't making a lot of sense.
Should warn you, I think Lestrade
filmed you on his phone.

SHERLOCK
Where is she?

JOHN
Where's who?

SHERLOCK
She was here, the woman, that woman.

Sherlock is looking around wildly - clearly no one else is
here, But the window - just'a little open, curtain blowing in
the breeze.

oRN
What woman?56.

SHERLOCK
‘The woman - the woman woman.

JOHN

Irene Adler? She got away, no one saw
her - che wasn't here, Sherlock.

Sherlock is checking under his bed now. John is hauling him
back to his feet.

JOHN
Back in bed, you'll be fine in the
morning. Just sleep!

SHERLOCK
Yes, of course I'll be fine. I am
fine, I'm absolutely fine!

He's climbing unsteadily back into bed.

JORN
Yep, you are, you're just great. 1/11
be right next door if you need me.

SHERLOCK
Why would I need you?

JOHN
No reason at all

And John goes, closing the door.
= revealing something hanging on the hook on the back.

Sherlock doen't see it for a moment - then does. His coat —
returned.

He stares at it for a moment. How did that happen?

And then - a little orgasmic gasp. Definitely female. where
did that cone from?

On his coat - something is glowing. He steps groggily, and
retrieves his own phone from the own pocket. He's received a
text (the gasp was the text arriving.) He reads it.

TEXT ON SCREEN: Good night, Mr. Holmes.

On Sherlock's face, frowning at the text. In the faint light
of the phone, we sce a kiss of lipstick on his cheek.

INT, 2218 BAKER STREET - MORNING

on MvcROPT, irate.87.

MYCROFT
How about the foreign legion?

Mycroft is pacing the floor, furious. SHERLOCK and JOHN are
having their breakfast, doing their best to ignore him. MRS
HUDSON is cleaning up in the kitchen, and generally not being
& housekeeper.

MYCROFT
Does one still join the foreign
Legion, when in disgrace - what is
the modern form? Do you retire to the
study with a loaded revolver, or take
a job in Manchester?

SHERLOCK
‘he photographs are perfectly safe.

MycROFT

In the hands of a fugitive sex
worker?

SHERLOCK
She's not interested in blackmail - 1
think she just wants ...

protection, for some reason. I take
Tevyoa've stood down the police
investigation into the shooting at
her house?

MycRoFt
How we can do anything, while she has
those photographs? Our hands are
tied.

SHERLOCK
She would applaud your choice of
words. You see how it works? That
camera is her get-out-of-jail free
card, You have to leave her alone.
Treat her like royalty, Mycroft.

ORK
hough not the way she treats
royalty.
Sherlock laughs = and as he does there's a little orgasmic gasp. Everyone
startles a little. Sherlock just picks up his phone, glances
at it.
ON SCREEN TEXT: Good morning, Mr. Holmes.

ORK
What was that?se.

SHERLOCK
Just a text.

JOHN
But what was the noise?

SHERLOCK
Did you know there were other people
after her too. Before you sent Jonn
and me in there? CIA trained killers,
at an excellent guess.

JOHN
Yeah, cheers for that, Mycroft.

Mrs Hudson pipes up from the kitchen.

ms HUDSON
It's disgrace, sending your little
brother into danger like that.
Family's all we have in the end,
Mycroft Holmes!

MycROFT
oh, shut up, Mrs Hudson!

‘SHERLOCK gouN

(outraged) (outraged)
Mycroft! oi!

‘Two indignant stares, and Mycroft realises he's crossed a
Line.

MYCROFT
(fo Mrs Hudgon)
Apologies.

MRS HUDSON
Thankyou!

SHERLOCK
Though do, in fact, shut up.

Another little orgasmic gasp.

Rs HUDSON
oh, it's a bit rude, that noise,
fen'e it?

Sherlock absently checks his phone as he continues talking John watching him, curiously.

SHERLOCK
There's nothing you can do for now ~
and nothing she will do, as far I
Gnderstand.59.

During above:
ON SCREEN TEXT: Feeling better?

Sherlock puts the phone down again.

MYCROFT
1 can put maximum surveillance on
her.

SHERLOCK

Why bother - you can follow her on
twitter, I believe her user name is
The Whip Hand.

MYCROFT
Yes, most amusing - excuse me.

He's now answering his phone, which has been buzzing. He
steps away for a whispered conversation.

John has been dying to know:

ORK
Way does your phone make that noise?
SHERLOCK
What noise?
JOHN
what noise - the one it just made.
SHERLOCK
It's a text alert, It means I've got
a text.
JOHN
Your texte don't usually make that

Sherlock now studying the paper, really not wanting to get
into this

SHERLOCK
Well. Someone got hold of my phone,
and for a joke, apparently,

Personalised their text alert noise.

ORM
So every time they text you .

Another orgasmic gasp.

SHERLOCK
It would seem so.60.

MRS HUDSON
(From the kitchen, a little
flustered)

Could you turn that phone down a bit,

at my time of life.

He glances at the phone:
ON-SCREEN TEXT: I'm fine, since you didn't ask.

He lays aside the phone again - pointedly, face down. John,
looking at him, pondering. Maybe even smiling a bit.

JOHN
I'm just wondering who could have got
hold of your phone recently. Cos it

would've been in your coat, wouldn't
ie?

SHERLOCK
I leave you to your deductions.

ORM
I'm not stupid, you know.

SHERLOCK
Where do you get that idea?

He glances over at Mycroft, just concluding his call.

MycROFt
Bond Air is go, that's decided check with the Coventry lot. Talk
ister.

Mycroft clicking stepping over, phone call done. The moment
he clicks

SHERLOCK
What else does she have?

(Off Mycroft's frown)
Irene Adler. The Americans wouldn't
be interested in a few compromising
photographs, there's more. A lot
more. There's something big coming
isn't there?

MYCROFT
Irene Adler is no longer any concern
of yours. From now, you will stay out
of this.

SHERLOCK
ob, wilt 1?ea.

MYCROFT
Yes, Sherlock, you will. Now if
you'll excuse me, I have a long and
Brduous apology to make to a very old
friend,

SHERLOCK
Give her my love.

He's snatched up his violin and plays Mycroft out the door God Save The Queen.

Mycroft just rolls his eyes - when will he grow up.
We cut to just outside the window, pulling back from the

Little domestic scene inside, We can still see Sherlock
playing, still hear the music, as we dissolve &

s+. the same window, but now there are CHRISTMAS LIGHTS
around it, and maybe even a little snow drifting past. and
the violin is still playing, but it's "We Wish You A Kerry
Christmas.

 

Inside. Christmas Eve in Baker Street. MRS HUDSON is sitting
inthe chair by the fire, looking happier than we have ever
seen her. JOHN, wearing 4 SANTA HAT, is pouring her a cup of
fea and JEANETTE (a pretty woman we haven't seen before) is
serving her a TRAY OF MINCE PIES. SHERLOCK stands on the run,
serenading her with his VIOLIN.

He comes to the end with an elaborate flourish and a deep
bow.

ms HUDSON
oh, that was lovely, Sherlock, just
lovely. But I wish you'd worn the
antlers.

SHERLOCK
Some things, Mrs. Hudson, are best
left to the imagination.

Lestrade pipes up from the kitchen - he's sitting there with
a drink, and he's probably had a few.

LESTRADE
Nah, I've got photoshop on my
computer - hours of fun after a day
of Sherlock.

JORN
veah.

(G£E Sherlock's look)
sorry.«2.

SHERLOCK
Still here, are you? I had no idea we
had so much gin. No thank you, Sarah.

He's speaking Jeanette who's offering him the tray of mince
pies. The room drops a degree.

John, appears next to Jeanette, arm round her.

ORN
He's not good at names.

SHERLOCK
No, hang on, I know this. Sarah was
the doctor one, then there was the
spotty one, the nose one, and who
came after the boring teacher?

JEANETTE
Nobody.

SHERLOCK
Jeanette! Process of elimination.

Now bustling through the doors, Molly Hooper, with big
shopping bags full of presents:

MouLY
Hello everyone, sorry, hello. It said
on the door, just to Come up.

MRS HUDSON
Molly, dear, in you come.

JORN
Hello, Molly!

SHERLOCK
(Under his breath)
oh dear Lord.

MOLLY
Are we having a Christmas drinkies
then?

SHERLOCK

There's no stopping them. Apparently.
Sherlock is now at this desk, busying himself.

MRS HUDSON
It's the one day a year the boys have
to be nice tome, It's almost worth
at.

SHERLOCK
John, this counter's stuck.
(MORE)3.

SHERLOCK (cont'd)
(He's pointing to John's Laptop)
on your biog, it's still 1895.

JOHN

oh no - Christmas is cancelled.
SHERLOCK

And you've got a photograph of me in

that hat!

on John's laptop screen, a photo of Sherlock in the
deerstalker ~ illustrating a story called "The Six
hatchers.

ORM
People like the hat.

SHERLOCK
No they don't, What people?

MOLLY
How's the hip?

MRS HUDSON
Atrocious, thanks for asking.

MOLLY
oh, I've seen worse. But then, 1 do
post-mortens.

Oh God, sorry, T just - ob!

SHERLOCK
Don't make jokes, Molly.
MOLLY

No.
LESTRADE

Hello, Moll.

MouLY
ob, hello, Detective Inspector - I
thought you were going to Dorset for
Christmas.

LESTRADE
First thing tomorrow, me and the
wife. Back together, all sorted.

SHERLOCK
No. She's sleeping with a PE teacher.

MOLLY
and John, I hear you're off to
your sister's, is that right?
Sherlock was complaining. Saying.6

JOHN
First time ever. She's cleaned up her
act, she's off the booze.

SHERLOCK

No.

OHM
shut up, Sherlock.

 

SHERLOCK
I see you've got a new boyfriend,
Molly, and you're serious about him.

Molly: instantly blushing.

MOLLY
What? Sorry, what?

 

SHERLOCK
And in fact, you're going to see him
this very night and deliver hima
present.

ORM
oh, what would Christmas be without a
Bit of deduction!

LESTRADE
Shut up and have a drink.

SHERLOCK
But surely you've noticed the top
present in the bag
He's pointing to a splendidly wrapped present, in red
wrapping paper.

 

SHERLOCK
Perfectly wrapped, with a bow,
whereas the others are all slapdash
Bt best. It's for someone special
then, The shade of red echoes her
Lipstick - either an unconscious
association, or one she's
deliberately trying to encourage.
Either way, Miss Hooper has love on
her mind. ‘That she's serious about
him, is Clear from the fact she's
giving him a Christmas gift at all that always suggests long term hopes,
however forlorn ~ and the fact that
she's seeing him tonight is evident

obviously trying to compensate for

As he speaks he's picked up the parcel, taken a look ~

Everyone avoiding looking at anyone - cos everyone saw this
train crash coming.

Finally

 

SHERLOCK
Thank you, Molly. This looks lovely.
How thoughtful.

on Molly. So humiliated. can't even look at him. Just gives a
Little nod. Maybe emits a tiny whimper.

SHERLOCK
I think John and I have a present for
you too.

He darts a hopeful look at John, who gives a pained little
nod.

Molly gives another little. Anywhere but here, right now,
please!!

Sherlock is about to step away. But no! He can do better!
He touches her arm.

SHERLOCK
Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper.

And he leans in and kisses her on the cheek. On John
watching - that's new! Even human!!

Sherlock straightens up from Molly, and she's all fine. shy
but so thrilled. And even attempting to raise her eyeline to
Sherlock's ... but the moment she does ~

~ an orgasmic gasp (Sherlock's phone.)

Molly's hand flies to her mouth.

MOLLY
No that wasn't ~ I didn't —

SHERLOCK
No, it's fine, it was me.

LESTRADE
My God, really?

SHERLOCK
My phone.66.

He's pulled his phone from his jacket, now looks at the text.
ON-SCREEN TEXT: Mantelpiece.

JOHN
Fifty-seven.

SHERLOCK
Sorry, what?

Sherlock is looking over at the Mantelpiece. There's a tiny
Little red parcel there, with a bow on it.

JOHN
Figty-seven of those texts - just the
ones I've heard.

SHERLOCK
How thrilling that you've counted.

Sherlock is now examining the little parcel. A bow on it.
Red. (NB. It s not identical to Molly's parcel, but clealy
the same set of impulses went into it.)

An orgasmic gasp. He checks his phone.

SHERLOCK

No. T think you're going to find her

As he says this he turns to see ~

Sherlock instantly snaps the phone off, stands, looks coldly
at John. Doesn't like being interrupted.

She's pulling back the sheet now.

MouLY
I'm afraid her face is a bit sort of

digescult.

Sherlock and Mycroft look coldly down. (We don't see.)

Molly hesitates, then pulls back the rest of the sheet.

BARTS/CORRIDOR - NIGHT

SHERLOCK, standing staring out of the window at the end of

MYCROFT appears next to him, holds up a cigarette, offering
it to him.

MYCROFT
Just the one.
SHERLOCK

MYCROFT

Merry Christmas.

Sherlock smiles, takes it. Mycroft starts lighting it for

SHERLOCK
Smoking indoors. Isn't there one of

MycROFT

damage you can do. How did you know
she was dead?

SHERLOCK
She had an item in her possession one she told me her life depended on.
She chose to give it up.

MYCROFT
Where is this item now?

Sherlock doesn't answer. He's looking down the corridor - at
the far, three people have emerged from the mortuary. A
MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE, and an OLDER WOMAN. They're all clutching
each other, sobbing. Clearly they have also had some bad
news. A mottuary attendant stands at a respectful distance.

Sherlock regards them, clinically.

SHERLOCK
Look at them. They all care so much.
Do you ever wonder if there's
something wrong with us?

MYCROFT
All lives end, all hearts are broken.
Caring is not'an advantage, Sherlock.

what last word, just a little pointed. Like a gentle,
brotherly warning.10.

Sherlock just sucks at his cigarette. Then frowns at it.

SHERLOCK
This is low tar.

mycRoFt
Well you barely knew her.

Sherlock gives an abrupt little laugh. Then starts heading
away down the corridor. As he goes ~

SHERLOCK
Merry Christmas, Mycroft.

We hold on Mycroft, framed against the window, the snow, and
the dark, Such a cold figure.

mycROF?
And a happy new year.

As Sherlock's footsteps echo away, Mycroft already has his
phone out, dialling. Now the phone is being answered.

JOHN sitting by the fire, Glass of brandy in hand, trying to
concentrate on a book. But really, he's waiting.

outside some drunken revellers are singing "God Rest Ye Merry
Gentlemen." Distant, lonely, eerie.

We hear the door. John looks round.

SHERLOCK, standing in the doorway, sombre. John, relieved to
see him, hiding it.

JORN
Hi. You okay?

Sherlock reflects for a moment. He scans around the room - a
forensic sweep of a look.

SHERLOCK

Hope you haven't messed up ay sock
index this time!

And we hear his bedroom door bang!
oh JOHN: damn! And over this we hear a soaring sad melody,
being played on a violin...

IND, 2218 BAKER STREET ~ DAY

SHERLOCK, in his DRESSING GOWN, is playing this sweetest
saddest tune on his VIOLIN. He’ stands at the window, focussed

on the music. JOHN is pottering about the flat - putting on
his coat, clearly about to go out.a.

MRS HUDSON is clearing away plates from where John and
Sherlock have been eating. John's plate is cleared,
Sherlock's is untouched.

Mrs Hudson pointedly shows the plate to John as she heads to
the kitchen He hasn't eaten again.

MRS HUDSON
Lovely tune. Haven't heard that one
before, Sherlock.

Sherlock stops for a moment, makes a mark on sheet of
manuscript.

ORK
Ave you composing?

SHERLOCK
Helps me think.

The sad, haunting tune continues.

JOHN
What are you thinking about?

And a discordant note from Sherlock - he throws down the
violin, strides over to where John's laptop stands open at
his deck, He's pulled from his dressing gown pocket, Irene's
leopard skin phone.

Sherlock has pulled up John's blog page. The counter still
stands at 1895.

SHERLOCK
Your blog counter - it's still stuck
at 1895.

feeling. No clue, He starts towards the stairs, passes Mrs
Hudson. On impulse, he pulls her aside.

Has he ever had ... anyone.
Girlfriend, boyfriend, any kind of

Black suited goons - TRANTER and a new one - standing by the
fireplace.

And now SHERLOCK comes strolling through the door, cool as
anything, hands clasped behind him, cool as anything — like
Prince Charles on an official visit.

Mrs Hudson gives a little whimper as she sees him.

SHERLOCK
Please don't snivel, Mrs. Hudson ~ it
does nothing to impede the flight of
a bullet. What a tender world that
would be:

Sorry, sherleck.

On Sherlock, as his eyes flick to:20.

zooming in on the ring on his finger. There's a tiny smear of
Blood.

NEILSON
I believe you have something that we
want, Mr. Holmes.

SHERLOCK
Then you should ask for it.

Sherlock has stepped forward to Mrs Hudson. Gently he pushes
one of her sleeves up - blotches on her arm. Finger marks
where she's been tightly gripped. Now his fingers go to where
there's a rip in her blouse ~ he’s almost tender. she's been
roughed up - and now she's shaking like a leaf.

NEILSON
I've been asking this one - she
doesn't seem to know anything. But
you know what I'm asking for, don't
you, Mr. Holmes?

Sherlock's gaze slams on to Neilson - a stare like cold blue
lasers.

SHERLOCK
I believe I do.

SHERLOCK
I’m unarmed.

NEILSON
You don't mind if 1 check?

SHERLOCK

Neilson steps forward, and with his gun still trained on him,
he starts briskly and efficiently risking with his other
hand. As he bends to his task, Sherlock helpfully raises his
hands over his head —

~ we pan up with them and now see what he's been concealing
behind him. The SPRAY ROPTLE from Mrs Hudson's cleaning
bucket, heid in his hand.

He glances at Mrs Hudson over Neilson’s shoulder. She's seen
the aerosol gives him an impish smile ~ he just rolls his
eyes at the stupidity of goons these day

So. She's alive then. How are we
feeling about that?

And from outeide, there are cheers, and fireworks going off.

SHERLOCK
Happy New Year, John.

JORN
Do you think you'll be seeing her

Sherlock just looks at him - he overheard that conversation
and they both know it. But he doesn't answer the question ~
or maybe he does. Still looking at John, he tucks the violin
under his chin, and starts to play.

Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind?

And days of old lang syne!

As Sherlock plays he's turned to the window. Looking out, he

face dirt-etreaked. She's been living rough.

on Sherlock's face: we can read nothing. From off we hear
SOHN arriving.

ORM
(From off)
Sherlock?
SHERLOCK
We have a client.
ORK
(From off)

What, in your bedroom.
He joins Sherlock in the doorway. Sees who it is.
JOHN
on.

IND. 2218 BAKER STREET — DAY

 

IRENE ~ showered now, in one of Sherlock's dressing gowns is curled in Sherlock's armchair, sipping some tea.

SHERLOCK and JOHN are with her.

SHERLOCK
Who's ater you?

IRENE ADLER
People who want to kill me.ae.

SHERLOCK
And who's that?

IRENE ADLER
Killers.

JOHN

Would help if you were a tiny bit
more specific.

IRENE ADLER
Tough. Where's my camera-phone?

JOHN
Not here, we're not stupid.

IRENE ADLER
‘Then what have you done with it? If
they've guessed you've got it,
they'll have been watching you.

SHERLOCK
If they've been watching me, they'11
know T took a safety deposit box at a
bank on the Strand, a few months ago.

IRENE ADLER
I need it.

JORN
Okay, but we can't just go and get
it, can we?

(fo sherlock)
Molly Hooper? She could pick it up,
take it to Barts. One of your
homeless network, could bring it
here, leave it in the cafe. One of
the guys could bring it up the back.

SHERLOCK
Very good, John - an excellent plan,
full of intelligent precautions.

ORN
Thank you, why don't I get straight
on to
But Sherlock has pulled the cameraphone from his pocket.

JOHN
okay.

 

INT, 2218 BAKER STREET - DAY

 

on the leopard skin CAMERA PHONE. Sherlock, in his armchair,
has it in his hand, is examining it.SHERLOCK
So what do you keep on here. In
general, I mean.

IRENE ADLER
Pictures. Information. Anything I
might find useful.

JOEN
For blackmail?

IRENE ADLER
For protection. I make my way in the
world. I misbehave. I like to know
there will be people on my side
exactly when I'need them to be.

SHERLOCK
And how do you acquire this
information?

IRENE ADLER
I told you - I misbehave.

SHERLOCK
But you've acquired something that is
more danger, than protection. Do you
know what it is.

IRENE ADLER
ves. But I don't understand it.

SHERLOCK
1 assumed. Show me.

She puts her hand out for the phone - Sherlock affects to

ignore that.

SHERLOCK
What's the passcode?

one hand with the other, and enters the code ~ and now frowns.

IRENE ADLER
It's not working.

Sherlock is already lifting cameraphone from her hand.

SHERLOCK
that's because it's a duplicate had
made.

(Checking the display)
Into which you just entered the
number 1058. Funny, I thought you'd
Choose something more specific.90.

He tosses the duplicate aside and produces the real leopard
skin camera phone from behind a book on the shelf.

SHERLOCK
But thanks anyway.

He punches in the number. on the screen.

It's flashing again.

 

WRONG PASSCODE
0 MORE APTEMPTS

He blinks in confusion - looks to Irene, who is smirking at
hin.

IRENE ADLER
It told you that camera phone is my
lige, I know when it's in my hand.

He passes it to her.

SHERLOCK
You're rather good.
IRENE ADLER
You're not so bad.
JORN
Hamish.
They look at him.
oRN

Jobh Hamish Watson. Just if you're
Looking for kids names.

IRENE ADLER
There wae a man - an MOD official and I knew what he Liked. One of the
things he Liked was showing off.

Passes the phone to Sherlock. A photograph of a computer
screen - on it we can see an email.

IRENE ADLER
He told me this email was going to
save the world, He didn't know 1
photographed it ~ he was a bit tied
ap at the time.

on the screen. The email is headed:

007 CONFIRMED ALLOCATION

And the content of the email is as follows.sa.

4c12045F13813G60A60R61F34134760D12H33K34K

Sherlock takes the cameraphone to his desk, examines now
bends over it, like he's trying to drink in’ every detail.

IRENE. ADLER
It's a bit small on that screen - can
you read it?

SHERLOCK
ves.
IRENE ADLER
Code obviously. I had one of the top
cryptographers in the country have
go at this - though he was mostly
upside down at the time! Couldn't
make anything of it. What can you do,
Me. Holmes?
She's at his shoulder now, leaning into him, flirty.

IRENE ADLER
Go on ~ impress a girl!

And impulsively she leans in to kiss his cheek ~ and time slows down!

on Irene, leaning in - glacier speed.

oh John, setting down his teacup - barel moving.

on Sherlock - he alone is normal speed, twitching, thinking,
brain on hyperdrive.

he code from the email now swirls on the screen in front of
hin 
4c12¢45P13813¢60A60R61F24134I60012H
- the letters and numbers spin and dance and re-arrange.
~ on Irene's lips moving closer, so very slowly ~

= on John's teacup, with maddening slowness, descending to
the saucer

Sherlock blinking, thinking, frowning, come on, come on!!
The letters swirling rearranging, now in their original
Line. (the following is fast, we don't hang around - this
will take a while to read but should be fluid and zippy on
screen.)

First we see the original line:92.

4c12045P13812G60A60R61F24134760012H
Then all the letters fade out leaving us with.

412 45 13 13 60 60 61 24 34 60 12

‘Then the letters return and the numbers fade leaving us with.
CCFEGABFIIDH

Sherlock blink, noticing something

 

The letters rearrange into alphaetical orde:
ABCCDEPFGHIG

Now the duplicate letters disappear to become

ABCDEFGHIG

Frowning, recognising, seen that before. Irene's lips,
closer.

John's teacup descending.

Now the letters all move slightly, some compressing, some
spreading out to become.

ABC DEFG HIT

Now boxes form around the letters, and we're zooming out to

~ the seating plan of the coach section of a passenger jet.

Now seat row numbers are appearing next to the rows of
letters, and we're streaking down the schematic to the back
row numbered as always 55:

And Sherlock just smiles at that.

and the kiss lands, and teacup chinks into the saucer, and
Sherlock says:

SHERLOCK
There's a margin for error, but I'm
pretty sure there's a 747 leaving
Gatwick at 6.30 tomorrow evening for
IA, and apparently it's going to save
the world. Not sure how that could be
true, but give mea moment, I've only
been on the case for eight seconds.

They just look at him, startled.93.

SHERLOCK
oh, come on, it's not code, these are
seat allocations on a passenger jet.
Look! “There are no letters past J ~
the width of the plane is the limit.
The nunbers only appear singly and
never in sequence, but the letters
have little runs of sequence all over
place - families and couples sitting
Eogether. Only a Jumbo is wide enough
to need a letter J, or rows past 55,
which always require an upstairs
Section. There's a row 13, 0 we can
eliminate the more superstitious
airlines. The style of the flight
Aunber - 007 ~ eliminates a few more,
and assuming a British point of
Origin, which would be logical given
the original source of the
information, and assuming from the
increased pressure on you lately,
that the crisis is inminent, the’ only
flight which matches all the criteria
and departs within a week, is the
6.30 to LA tomorrow evening, from
Gatwick airport.

Again just silence. That was alarming fast and clever. For
the first time, Irene is just staring at him in a general
state of wow!

SHERLOCK
Please don't feel obliged to tell me
that was remarkable or amazing. John
has expressed that thought in every
possible variant available to the
English language.

IRENE ADLER
I would have you, on this desk, right
now, till you begged for mercy,
twice.

SHERLOCK

seteseses-John, could you check
those flight schedules, see if 1'm
right?

JORN
yeah, right, on it, yeah.

 

He potters at a computer. Grateful to be out of the

Sherlock looks back at Irene, still that roasting stare from
a bit too close, He makes a modest flail for dignity.94.

SHERLOCK
Never begged for mercy in my life.
IRENE ADLER
nwice.
JOHN
Yep, you're right - 007, licensed to
fly:

on Sherlock - the words impact on him.

SHERLOCK
What did you say??

JOHN
I said, you're right.

SHERLOCK
No, after that, what did you say
after that??

ORM
007, licensed to fly. Sorry.

Sherlock distracted now, moving avay - something haunting
him, chining in his head.

on Irene, watching him, apparently worried ~
= but the camera swoops down behind her, closing on one hand
held slightly behind her. She has her phone in her hand and
is rapidly thumbing a text.

The words now running across the screen:

747 TOMORROW 6.30PM. GATWICK.

The words keep typing as the picture behind them dissolves
tor

EXT, WESTMINSTER BRIDGE ~ DAY

From behind, a MAN heading along. As the words complete,
there is the beep of a text arriving. The man stops walking,
pulls out his mobile phone, looks at it

= and as he does so, we swoop round in front of him. It's JIM

MORIARTY! He reads the text in mounting joy. A mad,
spreading, grin.

INT, 2218 BAKER STREET - DAY

 

On Sherlock, pacing now, bit frantic, trying to reach for
something95.

SHERLOCK
Licensed to fly, licensed to fly!
(laps his head)
There's something! What? what?
EXT, WESTMINSTER BRIDGE - DAY
JIM MORIARTY, rapidly texting away.
ON-SCREEN TEXT: Jumbo jet. Dear me, Mr. Holmes, dear me.
As Jim, he giggles happily, childichly. He glances up a Big
Ben and the House of Commons - and blows a big raspberry.
IND. 2218 BAKER STREET - DAY
Sherlock still pacing, still frantic.

SHERLOCK
Licensed to fly, license to ~

Then it hits him like a physical impact.
FLASHBACK: Mycroft on the phone, in this very flat.
MycROFT
(Repeating, on a loop)
Bond Air is go, Bond Air is go,
Bond Air is go, Bond Air is go’...

racking in on Sherlock's bemused face. What? What??

IND, MvcROFT'S STUDY - DAY

A blackberry on a leather-topped desk. It buzzes, a text
arriving. A hand reaches in, picks it up to read.

ON-SCREEN TEXT: Jumbo jet. Dear me, Mr . Holmes, dear me.
And the camera moves to reveal = Mycroft staring at the text in mounting horror.

We're pulling back from now, a smaller and smaller figure.
He's just received the worst news in the world. Dissolve to:

The sane pulling back shot, but now Mycroft is sitting in his
leather armchair, stricken“faced, 2 brandy in his hand.
Dissolve ¢

 

The same pulling back shot. Mycroft, sitting in the chair,
his head held in his hands. How the hell is he going to deal
with this one.96.

INT, 2218 BAKER STREET - NIGHT

 

SHERLOCK sprawled in his armchair, plucking listlessly at his
violin - the same sad tune he composed eariier, but he’s
probably unaware of that. Deep, deep, in thought.

Flashback.

MYCROFT
Bond Air is go, that's decided ~
check with the Coventry lot. Tale
Tater.

Sherlock frowning, distracted. Blinks, rewinds.
MycROFT
coventry ~ Coventry ~ Coventry Coventry
Wider shot. Someone's POV, as Sherlock cogitates.

on IRENE leaning in the kitchen doorway, watching him. Her

 

face: so sad. For the first time, she looks full of regrets.
SHERLOCK
coventry.
IRENE ADLER

Never been, is it nice?
Sherlock looks up a little startled.

SHERLOCK
Where's John?

IRENE ADLER
He went out - couple of hours ago.

SHERLOCK
But Twas just talking to him.

IRENE ADLER
He said you'd do that. What's
Coventry got to do with anything?

SHERLOCK
There's a story - possibly not true.
In the second world war, the allies
knew Coventry was going to be

bombed ~ because they'd broken the
Germans code. But they didn't want
the Germans to know they'd broken it,
50 they let the bombing happen

away

 

IRENE ADLER
Have you ever had anyone?97.

 

SHERLOCK
i'm sorry?
IRENE ADLER
And when I say "had", I'm being
indelicate.
SHERLOCK
1 don't understand.
IRENE ADLER
E/11 be delicate then. Let's have
dinner.
SHERLOCK
Way?
IRENE ADLER
You might be hungry.
SHERLOCK
I'm not.
IRENE ADLER
Goa.

She's kneeling by him now, taking his hand. (We note that he
Seems to reciprocate slightly, but a little clumsily.)

SHERLOCK
Why would T want to have dinner, if 1
wasn't bungry?

She's leaning in close to him - studying his face, hungrily.
He's equally fascinated, maybe a bit more forensic.

IRENE ADLER
Me. Holmes ... if it was end of the
world, if this was the very last

night’... would you have dinner with

on Sherlock, puzzled. Then there’s a knock at the door.

RS HUDSON
(From off)
Sherlock?
IRENE ADLER
roo late.
SHERLOCK

That's not the end of the world,
that's Mrs Hudson.

She gives the saddest look, like she knows he's wrong, and
moves away from him.se.

The door is opening - MRS HUDSON. Behind her we can see
PLUMMER - the man who first took Sherlock to Buckingham
Palace.

ms HUDSON
Sherlock, this man was at the door ig the bell still not working?

(Zo PLUMMER)
He shot it.

Plummer is already entering the room.

SHERLOCK
Are you taking me away again.
PLUMMER
Yes, Mr. Holmes.
SHERLOCK
1 decline.
PLUMMER

I don't think you do.

And Plummer has taken a long envelope from inside his jacket,
now passes it to Sherlock.

A puzzled Sherlock slits it open - and falling into his hand

a boarding pass. Flight 007 to LA, 18.30.

He stares at it. what??

EXT, BAKER STREET — NIGHT

SHERLOCK again climbing into the back of a big black car PLUMMER now climbing in next to hin.

The car starts to pull away. We pan up to IRENE ADLER,
standing at the window, watching it go.

 

INT, BIG BLACK CAR - NIGHT

 

PLUMMER and SHERLOCK in the back. The street lights flashing
across their faces. A silence. Then.

SHERLOCK
There's going to be a bomb on a
passenger jet. And the British and
American governments know about it.
And rather than expose the source of
their information they're going to
let the plane blow up:

(wore)98.

SHERLOCK (cont'd)
Coventry all over again. The wheel
turns, nothing is ever new.

PLUMMER
I read that blog your friend
weites about you.

 

SHERLOCK
And?

PLUMMER
And I didn't expect you to be an
idiot.

Silence resumes. Sherlock - just the trace of a frown.
Something's not good here.

Sherlock's POV. Lights and signs speeding past - we're
turning towards Gatwick.

EXT, AIRPORT ~ NIGHT

We're on a remote part of the airfield. A Jummo JEP standing
by a HANGER. The passenger staircase is in place.

The BIG BLACK CAR goes gliding up. Stops next to it. as
Sherlock climbs out he sees —

NEILSON and his TWO AMERICAN AGENTS standing at the foot of
the steps, like they're there to guide him on to the plane.

Sherlock, walking over to them now.

SHERLOCK
(To NEIESON)

Well you're looking all better. How

are you feeling?

NEILSON
Like putting a bullet in your brain,

He gestures to the steps, for Sherlock to ascend. sherlock
Starts heading up.

NEILSON
they'd pin a medal on me, if 1 did.
sir.

Sherlock just stops for a moment, registering that. Then

carries on up the steps.

IND, guMBO ~ NrgHT

 

Sherlock, leoking around.100.

The interior of the plane is darkened, creepy. The only light
from the portholes.

As Sherlock's eyes adjust to the gloom, he realises he's not
alone...

ss: all the seats are occupied. still, motionless figures,
Sitting and slumped. Sherlock steps closer to one of them ~
€licks on the overhead light. And there, in the little
Spotlight, is a a DEAD MAN.

He clicks on another light. A DEAD WOMAN.

Another light. Yet another DEAD PASSENGER.

on Sherlock: even for him, a neck-prickling realisation.
Everyone on this plane dead. A passenger manifest of corpses.

 

And then, impossible - a light nearer the front of the plane
seens to click on by itself. And there's a familiar voice.

MYCROFT
The Coventry conundrum. What do you
think of my solution?

And now a figure is rising from one the front seats, turn to
face him. Mycroft.

MYCROFT
The flight of the dead.

Sherlock, looking around, collecting himself, regaining his
cool.

SHERLOCK

the plane blows up in mid-air,

mission accomplished for the

terrorists, hundreds of casualties
‘and nobody dies.

 

mycROFr
Neat, don't you think? You've been
stumbling round the fringes of this
one for ages — of were you too bored
fo notice the pattern.

on Sherlock blinking, remembering
FLASHBACK; The big, beefy creepy guy, holding his Aunt's urn.

CREEPY GUY
1 know human ash!

FLASHBACK: The two little girls squeezed into the client
chair.101.

LITTLE GIRL
They wouldn't let us see Grandad when
he was dead ~

Back on the plane:

MYCROFT
We ran a similar project with the
Germans a while back ~ though I
understand one of our passengers
didn't make the light ~

FLASHBACK: Sherlock examining the inexplicable body in the
boot of the car.

MYCROFT
But that's the deceased for you late in every sense of the word.

SHERLOCK
How does the plane fly? of course,
unmanned aircraft, hardly new ~

MycROFT
It doesn't fly, it will never fly.
This entire project is cancelled. The
terrorist cells have been informed
that we know about the bomb ~ we
can't fool them now. We have lost
everything. One fragment of one
email - and months and years of
planning are finished.

SHERLOCK
Your MoD man

 

MycROFt
what's all it takes. One lonely,
naive man, desperate to show off, and
2 woman clever enough to make him
feel special...

SHERLOCK
You should screen your defence people
more carefully...

MycROFT
I'm not talking about the MoD man,
Sherlock, I'm talking about you!

on Sherlock. Rocked by that. No.

MYCROFT
A dansel in distress. In the end, are
you really so obvious? Give him love,
Yake it away, give him a puzzle, make
him dance...102.

SHERLOCK
Don't be absurd!

MycROFT
Absurd? How quickly did you decipher
that email for her - the full minute,
or were you really trying to impress?

IRENE ADLER
(From)

I think it was less than five

seconds.

Sherlock looks round. There's IRENE, standing at the entrance
to first class, NEILSON stands behind her, clearly has just
shown her up. She's still wearing Sherlock's dressing gown,
looks casual, relaxed.

Sherlock staring at her - guarded, unsure. Mycroft, genuinely
penitent.

MYCROFT
And I drove you into her path. I'm
sorry, I didn't know.

IRENE ADLER
Me. Holmes, I think we need to talk.

Sherlock, now striding towards her. Casual and assured now,
back to his old stuff.

SHERLOCK
I think so too, There are a number of
aspects i'm still not completely
clear on

IRENE ADLER
Not you, junior, you're done now.

And she simply walks past him, goes to Mycroft. She produces
her leopard skin cameraphone, tosses it in her hand.

IRENE. ADLER
There's more ~ loads more. And if you
Like, I'll keep on proving that. You
have'no idea how much havoc I can
cause, and exactly one way to stop

on Mycroft. No answer. Because she's right.

IND, MYCROFT's STUDY - NIGHT

MYCROF? at his desk. On the table in front of him, the
leopard skin camera-phone. Opposite is IRENE.103.

Standing with his back to them both, SHERLOCK looking out
into the night - a brooding, silent presence.

Mycroft prods the phone with his finger.

MYCROFT
We have people who can get into this.

IRENE ADLER
I tested that theory for you - 1 let
Sherlock Holmes try for six months
Sherlock, dear, tell him what you
found when you' x-rayed my camera
phone.

 

Sherlock doesn't turn, just speaks from where he's standing.

SHERLOCK
There are four additional unite wired
into the casing - I suspect
Containing acid or a small amount of
explosive, Any attempt to open the
casing, will burn the hard drive.

IRENE ADLER
Explosive. It's more me.

MYCROFT
Some data is always recoverable.

IRENE ADLER
wake that risk then.

MycROFT
you have a passcode to open this.
I deeply regret to say, we have
people who can extract it from you.

 

IRENE ADLER
Sherlock?

SHERLOCK
There will he two codes. One to open
the phone, one to burn the drive.
Even under duress, you can't know
which one she's given you. And there
Would be no point in a second
attempt.

IRENE ADLER
oh, isn't he good. I should have him
on'a leash. In fact, 1 might.

mycROFT

We destroy this then. No one has the
ingormation.104.

IRENE ADLER
Fine, good idea. Unless there are
Lives of British citizens depending
on the information you're about to
burn.

 

MYCROFT
Ave there?

IRENE ADLER
welling you, would be playing fair.
I'm not playing any more.

She's tossed him an envelope across the desk to Mycroft.

IRENE ADLER
A list of requests, and some ideas
about my protection once they're
granted.

Mycroft has slit open the envelope, glanced at the single
sheet.

IRENE ADLER
I'd say it wouldn't blow much of a
hole in the wealth of a nation, but
I'd be lying. I imagine you'd like to
sleep on it.

MYCROFT
Thank you, yes.

IRENE ADLER
Too bad. Off you pop and talk to

people.

He looks at her. A grim moment - total defeat. A polite
Little bow of his head.

MYCROFT
You've been very ... thorough. 1 wish
our lot were half as good as you.

IRENE ADLER
can't take all the credit. Got a bit
of help. Jim Moriarty sends his love.

On Sherlock's back - stiffening. On Mycroft, a sober note.

MycROFT

ves, he's been in touch. He seems to

be desperate for my attention.
(Wakes a note)

Which I'm sure can be arranged.108.

IRENE ADLER
I had all this stuff, never really
ienew what to do with’ it, Thank God,
for the consultant criminal. Gave me
lots of advice on how to play the
Holmes boys. Do you know what he
calls you~ the Ice Man. And the
Virgin.

on Sherlock again, Still not turning, still not rising to it.

He starts

Sherlock,

IRENE ADLER
Didn't even ask for anything. I think
he just likes to cause trouble. Now
that's my kind of man.

MYCROFT
And here you are. The dominatrix who
Brought a nation to its knees. Nicely
played.

to stand, but 
SHERLOCK
(Still without turning)
No.

IRENE ADLER
i'm sorry?

turning now. Quite his old self, cold as ice.

SHERLOCK
I said, no. Very, very close, but no.
You got carried away, the game was
far too elaborate - you enjoyed
yourself too much.

IRENE ADLER
There's no such thing as too much.

SHERLOCK
Enjoying thrill of the chase is fine.
Craving the distraction of the game —
I entirely sympathise. But sentiment?
Sentiment is a chemical defect found
in the losing side.

IRENE ADLER
Sentiment? What are you talking
about?

SHERLOCK

vou.106.

IRENE ADLER
Oh dear God, look at the poor man.
You don't think 1 was actually
interested in you? Why? Because
you're the great Sherlock Holmes? The
Glever detective with the funny hat?

SHERLOCK
No. Because I took your pulse.

FLASHBACK: in 2218, Irene taking Sherlock's hand, Sherlock
clunsily reciprocating - but actually taking her pulse.

SHERLOCK
Elevated. Your pupils dilated.

FLASHBACK: Irene studying his face hungrily. Sherlock
staring, back forensic. Closer now on ner dilating pupil.

SHERLOCK
I imagine John Watson thinks love is
a mystery to me. But the chemistry is
terribly simple. And very
destructive.

He's walking round the desk - in swanning about, explaining
mode. He picks up her canera-phone.

on Irene - just the first uncertainty. Is she in trouble now?

SHERLOCK
You told me, when we first met, that
@isguise is’ always a self-portrait.
How true of you. The combination of
your safe - your measurements. But
this —

(fosses the camera-phone in his hand)
his is more intimate. It's your
heart. And you should never let it
rule your head.

(Presses one key. A beep)
vou could have chosen any random
number and you'd have walked away
today, with everything you worked
for.

(another key ~ beep)
put you couldn't resist it, could
you? I've always assumed that love
was a dangerous disadvantage 
(Beep)
thank you for the final proof.

He holds the phone out to her, displaying the screen.

Irene, rocked already, just stares at it. Everything is lost.
Maybe there's even a tear in her eye, as she looks up at him.107.

IRENE ADLER
Everything I said tonight — it wasn't
real. Tt was just playing the game.

SHERLOCK
I know. And this is just losing.

whe final beep. And now we see the fully entered code.
Letters not numbers, and the screen now reads:

1AM
fesresiesies)
LOCKED
he screen flashes, folds out into menu displays.

SHERLOCK
And so you are.

He tosses it to Mycroft.

SHERLOCK
There you go, brother. I hope the
contents make up for any
inconvenience I've caused you this
evening.

Mycroft, benusedly staring at the phone. He's pleased at the
victory, but just a little chilled at how Sherlock won.

MYCROFT
i'm certain they will...

SHERLOCK
If you're feeling kind, lock her up.
Tf not, let her go. 1 doubt she'll
last long without her protection.

IRENE ADLER
Are you expecting me to beg?

SHERLOCK
ves.

He turns, heading to the door, almost gets there 
IRENE ADLER
Please.

He looks round. she's standing now - so vulnerable. Pleading.
IRENE ADLER

You're right. I won't last six
months. Please.108.

Pushing in Sherlock now - that cold, cruel face.

SHERLOCK
Sorry about dinner.

And he goes, closing the door behind him. And slowly we fade
£0 black.

EXT, BAKER STREET — DAY

It's winter again - and raining like hell: a day for terrible
news. JOHN ie dashing along through the downpour. He stops as
he sees an unfamiliar sight.

MYCROF?, leaning against the wall, outside Speedy's. He's
under shelter of the awning and smoking. He has big ziplock
file under his arm. John approaches.

JOHN
You don't smoke.

mycrorr
I also don't frequent cafes.

He turns and heads into Speedy's, clearly expecting John to
follow.

IND, SPEEDY'S CAPE ~ DAY

MYCROFT and JOHN, sitting across the table from each other,
with coffees. Silence for a moment - just the hise of the
rain outside, the under-sea gloom of the cafe, the soaking

"Ghankyou". Her EXECUTIONER is stepping up behind her now,
ewinging back with his long aword.

Closer on Irene now, as she straightens her neck and prepares
herself for the end. So sad, so full of regrets. she slowly
closes her eyes.

And as her eyes close, the screen fades into darkness.

We hold the darkness for a long final moment, like the movie
really is over. Then:
