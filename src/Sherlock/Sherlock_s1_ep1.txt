I know you like writing about

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

has to be one.

the work of a serial killer?

suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

Obviously this is a frightening
time for people, but all anyone has
to do is exercise reasonable
precautions. We are all as safe as
we want to be.

A moment of frantic scribbling - good quote! - and then a

You've got to stop him doing that.

LESTRADE

You tell me how he does it, I'll

stop him.

Lestrade has slammed into his office, heading straight to his

Closer on Lestrade, about to sit down. Lying on his desk,

Lestrade is stepping through a service door, on the flat
roof. He starts to light the cigarette.

He speaks lightly and casually, knowing there’s someone there
to hear.

LESTRADE
Trying to give these up actually.

I was thinking of a pipe. What do
pipes do for you cigarettes don’t?

A beat - and a cultured voice from off.

Cancer of the jaw.

Lestrade laughs, looks round. A tall, thin man is standing
with his back to us right at the edge of the roof, looking
out over London. A silhouette.

LESTRADE
Okay. What am I getting wrong this
time?

SHERLOCK

No notes. No prior sign. Each of
them in a strange location that
means nothing to them where they’ve
never gone before... That’s not
how I‘d kill myself.

He raises his Cappuccino for a sip, but as he lifts it (in

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

getting cross.

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of

treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

REPORTER

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

getting cross.

we want to be.

at the end.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

REPORTER
Sorry, I 
SALLY
If you've all got texts, please
ignore them.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

REPORTER
It just says “Wrong”

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

18/04/10

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

Close on Sally, reading the signs - Lestrade is
getting cross.

to do is exercise reasonable
precautions. We are all as safe as
we want to be.

How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN

I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an

If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

riding crop. Whack!! Whack!! Whack!!

On Miss. Hooper watching. Perhaps a girlish flutter.
Sherlock appears in shot, tossing the riding crop aside.

MISS. HOOPER
So. Bad day, was it?

Sherlock ignores her little joke, is making notes on a pad.

SHERLOCK
I need to know what bruises form in

SHERLOCK
Are you wearing lipstick? You

You've no idea.

Without glancing up from his computer:
SHERLOCK

MIKE
What’s wrong with the landline?

SHERLOCK
I'd rather text.

Mike has reached inside his jacket -
MIKE
Sorry. Other coat.

Sherlock has swivelled round in his chair -

jacket and is proffering his phone (a rather swish smart
phone - but NOT an iPhone.)

SHERLOCK

Oh, thank you.

This is an old friend of mine John Watson.

Sherlock has barely glanced at John, is now texting away on
his phone.

Coffee! Thank you, Molly! What
happened to the lipstick?

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER
It ... wasn’t working for me.

SHERLOCK

Really? I thought it was a big

She stares at him. He’s still completely oblivious to the
effect he’s having, texting away.

MISS. HOOPER

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each
other.

John, flummoxed - looks to Mike.

JOHN
Oh! You told him about me?

Mike has been watching this with a knowing air. Enjoying the
routine.

MIKE
Not a word.

JOHN

flatmates?

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this
morning, that I was a difficult man
to finda flatmate for. Now he
turns up after lunch with an old
friend Clearly just home from
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn’t a difficult leap.

JOHN
«++ how did you know about
Afghanistan?

But Sherlock isn’t really listening. He’s logging out of the

computer, pulling on his jacket.

SHERLOCK
I’ve got my eye on a nice little
place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

(Heading for the door)

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

JOHN
Is that it?

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site

this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but

A drip is drawn down the centre of the screen, splitting the

Sherlock: early thirties, tall, lean, imperious. He is
plainly but neatly dressed.

Next to him, Miss. Hooper: lab-coated, clearly works here.
MISS. HOOPER
Just in. 67, natural causes. Used
to work here, donated his body. I

Sherlock turns into a hero close-up.

SHERLOCK
Fine. We'll start with the riding

Few minutes later: on Miss. Hooper, watching from the side of
the room. Sherlock’s shadows flap over the wall, huge and
terrifying. He’s slashing at the dissecting table with the
riding crop. Whack!! Whack!! Whack!!

On Miss. Hooper watching. Perhaps a girlish flutter.
Sherlock appears in shot, tossing the riding crop aside.

MISS. HOOPER
So. Bad day, was it?

Sherlock ignores her little joke, is making notes on a pad.

SHERLOCK
I need to know what bruises form in
the next twenty minutes. Text me.

MISS. HOOPER
Listen, I was wondering, maybe
later, when you're finished -
SHERLOCK
Are you wearing lipstick? You
weren't wearing lipstick before.

MISS. HOOPER
I just ... refreshed it a bit.

SHERLOCK
Sorry, you were saying?

MISS. HOOPER
I was wondering if you’d like to

From the other end of the room:

The door opening, voices. Beyond Sherlock we see John and
Mike coming into the room.

JOHN
Bit different from my day.

MIKE
You've no idea.

Without glancing up from his computer:
SHERLOCK
Mike, can I borrow your phone? No
signal on mine.

MIKE
What’s wrong with the landline?

SHERLOCK
I'd rather text.

Mike has reached inside his jacket -
MIKE
Sorry. Other coat.

JOHN

Sherlock has swivelled round in his chair -
=- to see John Watson, who has already reached into his
jacket and is proffering his phone (a rather swish smart
phone - but NOT an iPhone.)

SHERLOCK
(Taking it)
Oh, thank you.
MIKE
This is an old friend of mine John Watson.

Sherlock has barely glanced at John, is now texting away on
his phone.

JOHN

SHERLOCK
Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN

did you -
He's interrupted as Molly Hooper comes through the door,
bearing coffee.

SHERLOCK
Coffee! Thank you, Molly! What
happened to the lipstick?

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER
It ... wasn’t working for me.

SHERLOCK

Really? I thought it was a big
improvement - mouth’s too small
now.

She stares at him. He’s still completely oblivious to the
effect he’s having, texting away.

MISS. HOOPER
ses okay.

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each
other.

John, flummoxed - looks to Mike.

JOHN
Oh! You told him about me?

Mike has been watching this with a knowing air. Enjoying the
routine.

16.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

MIKE
Not a word.

JOHN
.++ then who said anything about
flatmates?

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this
morning, that I was a difficult man
to finda flatmate for. Now he
turns up after lunch with an old
friend Clearly just home from
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn’t a difficult leap.

JOHN
«++ how did you know about
Afghanistan?

18/04/10

But Sherlock isn’t really listening. He’s logging out of the

computer, pulling on his jacket.

SHERLOCK
I’ve got my eye on a nice little
place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

(Heading for the door)

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

JOHN
Is that it?

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I
don’t even know where we’re
meeting!

Sherlock looks at him, a tiny smile - he loves this part.

SHERLOCK
I know you’re an army doctor and
you've been invalided home from
Afghanistan.

SHERLOCK (cont'd)
I know you've got a brother with a
bit of money who's worried about
you, but you won't go to him for
help because you don’t approve of
him - possibly because he’s an
alcoholic, more likely because he
recently walked out on his wife.
And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp is psychosomatic quite correctly, I’m afraid.
That’s enough to be going on with,
don’t you think?

John is staring at him. Utter astonishment. What? What??

Sherlock has turned on his heel, and is walking out the door.

Something slightly dazed and pained in his’eyes. He's been

Looks around the room. A bare minimum of personal

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.
Can't quite grasp that he’s really going to do this —

For a moment, nothing. And under this a voice - tremulous,
tearful.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

Coffee! Thank you, Molly! What

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this

Wasn’t a difficult leap.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

getting cross.

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN

JOHN
You said you could identify a

Yes. And I can read your military

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

Close on Sally, reading the signs - Lestrade is
getting cross.

precautions. We are all as safe as
we want to be.

Mr. Holmes!

He's ringing the doorbell on 221b.

The room is fairly large and pleasant - and a dreadful mess.
Stacks of newspapers, several computers, a tumble of box

collection of what look’like weapons, a skull on the

Well! This could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN
Looked you up on the Internet last

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN
Found your website - The Science of

SHERLOCK

What did you think?

JOHN
You said you could identify a

an airline pilot by his left’ thumb.

SHERLOCK
Yes. And I can read your military

and the drinking habits of your
brother in your mobile phone.

JOHN
How?

Mrs. Hudson has been bustling about, straightening up. She's

picked up a newspaper from the floor.

MRS. HUDSON
What about these suicides, then,
Sherlock? Thought that would be
right up your street. Three of
them, exactly the same. That’s a
bit funny, isn’t it?

there's something different this

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

JOHN
Is that it?

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I
don’t even know where we’re
meeting!

Sherlock looks at him, a tiny smile - he loves this part.

SHERLOCK (cont'd)
I know you've got a brother with a
bit of money who's worried about
you, but you won't go to him for
help because you don’t approve of
him - possibly because he’s an
alcoholic, more likely because he
recently walked out on his wife.
And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp is psychosomatic quite correctly, I’m afraid.
That’s enough to be going on with,
don’t you think?

John is staring at him. Utter astonishment. What? What??

Sherlock has turned on his heel, and is walking out the door.

Mr. Holmes!

Sherlock, please.

He's ringing the doorbell on 221b.

The room is fairly large and pleasant - and a dreadful mess.
Stacks of newspapers, several computers, a tumble of box
files along the shelves, books everywhere, a terrifying
collection of what look’like weapons, a skull on the
mantlepiece. An adjoining kitchen, the table crammed with
testubes and jars and bunsen burners.

Well! This could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.

Mrs. Hudson comes bustling in.

John looks at her, a little affronted.

Oh, Sherlock, the mess you've made.

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN
Looked you up on the Internet last
night.

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN
Found your website - The Science of
Deduction.

SHERLOCK

What did you think?

JOHN
You said you could identify a
software designer by his tie, and
an airline pilot by his left’ thumb.

SHERLOCK
Yes. And I can read your military
career in your face and your leg,
and the drinking habits of your
brother in your mobile phone.

JOHN
How?

Mrs. Hudson has been bustling about, straightening up. She's

picked up a newspaper from the floor.

MRS. HUDSON
What about these suicides, then,
Sherlock? Thought that would be
right up your street. Three of
them, exactly the same. That’s a
bit funny, isn’t it?

On Sherlock, staring, like he’s sensing something in the air.

SHERLOCK

Four. There’s been a fourth. And
there's something different this
time.

MRS. HUDSON
A fourth? How do you know?
For answer, he points to the window.

They look: a blue light is flashing outside - clearly a
police car is parked below.

Feet thumping on the stairs, and suddenly in the doorway -DI Lestrade.

SHERLOCK
Where?

LESTRADE
Brixton. Lauriston Gardens.

SHERLOCK
What's different about this one.
You wouldn't have come to get me,

SHERLOCK
Yeah.

LESTRADE

Sherlock just looks at him. Tempted now, interested.

SHERLOCK

LESTRADE

SHERLOCK
Anderson won't work with me.

LESTRADE
He won't be your assistant.

SHERLOCK
But I need an assistant.

LESTRADE
Will you come?

SHERLOCK
Not in a police car. I'll be right

LESTRADE
Thankyou!

A cursory nod at Mrs. Hudson, and John, and he’s gone.

233A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

John is thunderstruck - a cat at a tennis match. Mrs. Hudson
just looks faintly knowing.

And Sherlock lets a whoop of excitement.

SHERLOCK
Brilliant!

He leaps right over the sofa, dashes to his desk, starts
stuffing things in his pockets - his kit.

SHERLOCK
And I thought it was going to be a
boring evening. Serial suicides,
and now a note ~ oh, it’s
Christmas!

(Dashes for the door)
Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late - might
need some food.

MRS. HUDSON
I’m your landlady, dear, not your
housekeeper.

SHERLOCK

Something cold is fine. John make
yourself at home - have a cuppa!
Don’t wait up!

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

MRS. HUDSON
(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third
“Suicide’ found” there’s a photograph.

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down
type, I can tell. 1/11 make you
that cuppa, you rest your leg.

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

They all took the same poison.

had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -

Apparently you can.

nothing that links them?

but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at

the work of a serial killer?

I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

Sherlock at his laptop, tapping away. On his fingers typing so fast, like a’machine.

From the other end of the room:

The door opening, voices. Beyond Sherlock we see John and
Mike coming into the room.

JOHN
Bit different from my day.

MIKE
You've no idea.

Without glancing up from his computer:
SHERLOCK
Mike, can I borrow your phone? No
signal on mine.

MIKE
What’s wrong with the landline?

SHERLOCK
I'd rather text.

Mike has reached inside his jacket -
MIKE
Sorry. Other coat.

JOHN
Here. Use mine

Sherlock has swivelled round in his chair -
=- to see John Watson, who has already reached into his
jacket and is proffering his phone (a rather swish smart
phone - but NOT an iPhone.)

SHERLOCK
(Taking it)
Oh, thank you.
MIKE
This is an old friend of mine John Watson.

Sherlock has barely glanced at John, is now texting away on
his phone.

SHERLOCK
Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN

SHERLOCK
Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN

did you -
He's interrupted as Molly Hooper comes through the door,
bearing coffee.

SHERLOCK
Coffee! Thank you, Molly! What
happened to the lipstick?

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER
It ... wasn’t working for me.

SHERLOCK

Really? I thought it was a big
improvement - mouth’s too small
now.

She stares at him. He’s still completely oblivious to the
effect he’s having, texting away.

MISS. HOOPER

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each
other.

John, flummoxed - looks to Mike.

JOHN
Oh! You told him about me?

Mike has been watching this with a knowing air. Enjoying the
routine.

16.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

MIKE
Not a word.

JOHN

flatmates?

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this
morning, that I was a difficult man
to finda flatmate for. Now he
turns up after lunch with an old
friend Clearly just home from
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn’t a difficult leap.

JOHN
«++ how did you know about
Afghanistan?

18/04/10

But Sherlock isn’t really listening. He’s logging out of the

computer, pulling on his jacket.

SHERLOCK
I’ve got my eye on a nice little
place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

(Heading for the door)

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I
don’t even know where we’re

bit of money who's worried about
you, but you won't go to him for
help because you don’t approve of
him - possibly because he’s an
alcoholic, more likely because he

And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp is psychosomatic quite correctly, I’m afraid.
That’s enough to be going on with,

Mr. Holmes!

SHERLOCK
Sherlock, please.

JOHN

He's ringing the doorbell on 221b.

The room is fairly large and pleasant - and a dreadful mess.
Stacks of newspapers, several computers, a tumble of box
files along the shelves, books everywhere, a terrifying
collection of what look’like weapons, a skull on the
mantlepiece. An adjoining kitchen, the table crammed with
testubes and jars and bunsen burners.

JOHN
Well! This could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.

SHERLOCK
Yes, I think so. My thoughts

So, this is all -

JOHN

Mrs. Hudson comes bustling in.

MRS. HUDSON
What do you think, Dr. Watson —
there’s another bedroom upstairs.

If you'll be needing two bedrooms

John looks at her, a little affronted.

Well of course we'll be needing

MRS. HUDSON
Oh don’t you worry, all sorts round

Oh, Sherlock, the mess you've made.

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN
Looked you up on the Internet last
night.

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN
Found your website - The Science of
Deduction.

SHERLOCK

What did you think?

JOHN
You said you could identify a
software designer by his tie, and
an airline pilot by his left’ thumb.

SHERLOCK
Yes. And I can read your military
career in your face and your leg,
and the drinking habits of your
brother in your mobile phone.

JOHN
How?

Mrs. Hudson has been bustling about, straightening up. She's

picked up a newspaper from the floor.

MRS. HUDSON
What about these suicides, then,
Sherlock? Thought that would be
right up your street. Three of
them, exactly the same. That’s a
bit funny, isn’t it?

On Sherlock, staring, like he’s sensing something in the air.

SHERLOCK

Four. There’s been a fourth. And
there's something different this
time.

225A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10
MRS. HUDSON
A fourth? How do you know?
For answer, he points to the window.

They look: a blue light is flashing outside - clearly a
police car is parked below.

Feet thumping on the stairs, and suddenly in the doorway -DI Lestrade.

SHERLOCK
Where?

LESTRADE
Brixton. Lauriston Gardens.

SHERLOCK
What's different about this one.
You wouldn't have come to get me,
if there wasn’t something new.

LESTRADE
You know how they never leave
notes?

SHERLOCK
Yeah.

LESTRADE

This one did. Will you come?
Sherlock just looks at him. Tempted now, interested.

SHERLOCK

LESTRADE
Anderson.

SHERLOCK
Anderson won't work with me.

LESTRADE
He won't be your assistant.

SHERLOCK
But I need an assistant.

LESTRADE
Will you come?

SHERLOCK
Not in a police car. I'll be right
behind you.

LESTRADE
Thankyou!

A cursory nod at Mrs. Hudson, and John, and he’s gone.

233A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

John is thunderstruck - a cat at a tennis match. Mrs. Hudson
just looks faintly knowing.

And Sherlock lets a whoop of excitement.

SHERLOCK
Brilliant!

He leaps right over the sofa, dashes to his desk, starts
stuffing things in his pockets - his kit.

SHERLOCK
And I thought it was going to be a
boring evening. Serial suicides,
and now a note ~ oh, it’s
Christmas!

(Dashes for the door)
Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late - might
need some food.

MRS. HUDSON
I’m your landlady, dear, not your
housekeeper.

SHERLOCK

Something cold is fine. John make
yourself at home - have a cuppa!
Don’t wait up!

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

MRS. HUDSON
(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third
“Suicide’ found” there’s a photograph.

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down
type, I can tell. 1/11 make you
that cuppa, you rest your leg.

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

JOHN

I'm sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s just
sometimes’... bloody thing.

Just this once, dear - I’m not your

John is settling down on the sofa - disconsolate, annoyed at
himself.

JOHN
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got them.

MRS. HUDSON

Not your housekeeper.

John, sitting there, frowning: Sherlock Holmes - who the hell
is he?

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

SHERLOCK
(From off)
You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

SHERLOCK

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior

late last night on a building site

investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and

suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

John’s hand, pumping it.

MIKE

MIKE
Bad, is it?

He bites that answer off. Doesn’t want to get into all that.
He raises his Cappuccino for a sip, but as he lifts it (in
his left hand) his hand is shaking’ badly. He's aware that
Mike is staring at it. Just sets it down again. Does NOT
want to get into this.

MIKE
Couldn't Harry help?

John just gives him a look.

JOHN
Yeah, that’s going to happen.

MIKE

For a moment blackness, the zzzziiiippp.

A drip is drawn down the centre of the screen, splitting the
darkness on a thin face staring down at us - Clinical,
fascinated, and from our POV upside down. This is Sherlock
Holmes.

SHERLOCK
How fresh?

Wider. Sherlock stands over a body bag lying on dissection
table. He has just unzipped it to inspect the contents.

Sherlock: early thirties, tall, lean, imperious. He is
plainly but neatly dressed.

Next to him, Miss. Hooper: lab-coated, clearly works here.
MISS. HOOPER
Just in. 67, natural causes. Used
to work here, donated his body. I
knew him. He was nice.

Sherlock turns into a hero close-up.

SHERLOCK
Fine. We'll start with the riding
crop.

Few minutes later: on Miss. Hooper, watching from the side of
the room. Sherlock’s shadows flap over the wall, huge and
terrifying. He’s slashing at the dissecting table with the
riding crop. Whack!! Whack!! Whack!!

On Miss. Hooper watching. Perhaps a girlish flutter.
Sherlock appears in shot, tossing the riding crop aside.

MISS. HOOPER
So. Bad day, was it?

Sherlock ignores her little joke, is making notes on a pad.

SHERLOCK
I need to know what bruises form in
the next twenty minutes. Text me.

MISS. HOOPER
Listen, I was wondering, maybe
later, when you're finished -
SHERLOCK
Are you wearing lipstick? You
weren't wearing lipstick before.

MISS. HOOPER
I just ... refreshed it a bit.

SHERLOCK
Sorry, you were saying?

MISS. HOOPER
I was wondering if you’d like to
have coffee?

SHERLOCK

Black, two sugars, please I'll be

Sherlock at his laptop, tapping away. On his fingers typing so fast, like a’machine.

From the other end of the room:

The door opening, voices. Beyond Sherlock we see John and
Mike coming into the room.

JOHN
Bit different from my day.

MIKE
You've no idea.

Without glancing up from his computer:
SHERLOCK
Mike, can I borrow your phone? No
signal on mine.

MIKE
What’s wrong with the landline?

SHERLOCK
I'd rather text.

Mike has reached inside his jacket -
MIKE
Sorry. Other coat.

JOHN
Here. Use mine

Sherlock has swivelled round in his chair -
=- to see John Watson, who has already reached into his
jacket and is proffering his phone (a rather swish smart
phone - but NOT an iPhone.)

SHERLOCK
(Taking it)
Oh, thank you.
MIKE
This is an old friend of mine John Watson.

Sherlock has barely glanced at John, is now texting away on
his phone.

SHERLOCK
Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN

SHERLOCK
Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN
+. Afghanistan. I’m sorry, how
did you -
He's interrupted as Molly Hooper comes through the door,
bearing coffee.

SHERLOCK
Coffee! Thank you, Molly! What
happened to the lipstick?

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER
It ... wasn’t working for me.

SHERLOCK

Really? I thought it was a big
improvement - mouth’s too small
now.

She stares at him. He’s still completely oblivious to the
effect he’s having, texting away.

MISS. HOOPER
ses okay.

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each
other.

John, flummoxed - looks to Mike.

JOHN
Oh! You told him about me?

Mike has been watching this with a knowing air. Enjoying the
routine.

16.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

MIKE
Not a word.

JOHN
.++ then who said anything about
flatmates?

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this
morning, that I was a difficult man
to finda flatmate for. Now he
turns up after lunch with an old
friend Clearly just home from
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn’t a difficult leap.

JOHN
«++ how did you know about
Afghanistan?

18/04/10

But Sherlock isn’t really listening. He’s logging out of the

computer, pulling on his jacket.

SHERLOCK
I’ve got my eye on a nice little
place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

(Heading for the door)

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

JOHN
Is that it?

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I
don’t even know where we’re
meeting!

Sherlock looks at him, a tiny smile - he loves this part.

SHERLOCK
I know you’re an army doctor and
you've been invalided home from
Afghanistan.

SHERLOCK (cont'd)
I know you've got a brother with a
bit of money who's worried about
you, but you won't go to him for
help because you don’t approve of
him - possibly because he’s an
alcoholic, more likely because he
recently walked out on his wife.
And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp is psychosomatic quite correctly, I’m afraid.
That’s enough to be going on with,
don’t you think?

John is staring at him. Utter astonishment. What? What??

Sherlock has turned on his heel, and is walking out the door.
He turns

SHERLOCK

Hi.

John looks round. Sherlock has just climbed out of a cab,
and is now paying the cabbie.

JOHN
Mr. Holmes!

SHERLOCK
Sherlock, please.

JOHN
Prime spot. Got to be expensive.

He's ringing the doorbell on 221b.

SHERLOCK
Mrs. Hudson, the landlady. she’s
giving me a’ special deal. Owes me
a favour - few years ago, her
husband got himself sentenced to
death in Florida. I was able to
help out.

John gives him on openly skeptical look. Who is this guy?

SHERLOCK

Oh, no. I ensured it.

On the door, as it is opened. John steps into the room,
looking around - Sherlock behind him.

The room is fairly large and pleasant - and a dreadful mess.
Stacks of newspapers, several computers, a tumble of box
files along the shelves, books everywhere, a terrifying
collection of what look’like weapons, a skull on the
mantlepiece. An adjoining kitchen, the table crammed with
testubes and jars and bunsen burners.

JOHN
Well! This could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.

SHERLOCK
Yes, I think so. My thoughts
exactly.

Soon as we get all this So I went ahead and moved in.

They look at each other. Oh!

JOHN
So, this is all -
SHERLOCK
Obviously I can straighten things
up a bit.

JOHN

That’s a skull

SHERLOCK
Friend of mine. Well I say friend

Mrs. Hudson comes bustling in.

MRS. HUDSON
What do you think, Dr. Watson —
there’s another bedroom upstairs.
(Knowing look)
If you'll be needing two bedrooms

John looks at her, a little affronted.

21.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

JOHN
Well of course we'll be needing
two.

MRS. HUDSON
Oh don’t you worry, all sorts round
here. Mrs. Turner next door’s got
married ones.
(Looking around)
Oh, Sherlock, the mess you've made.

18/04/10

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN
Looked you up on the Internet last
night.

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN
Found your website - The Science of
Deduction.

SHERLOCK

What did you think?

JOHN
You said you could identify a
software designer by his tie, and
an airline pilot by his left’ thumb.

SHERLOCK
Yes. And I can read your military
career in your face and your leg,
and the drinking habits of your
brother in your mobile phone.

JOHN
How?

Mrs. Hudson has been bustling about, straightening up. She's

picked up a newspaper from the floor.

MRS. HUDSON
What about these suicides, then,
Sherlock? Thought that would be
right up your street. Three of
them, exactly the same. That’s a
bit funny, isn’t it?

On Sherlock, staring, like he’s sensing something in the air.

SHERLOCK

Four. There’s been a fourth. And
there's something different this
time.

225A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10
MRS. HUDSON
A fourth? How do you know?
For answer, he points to the window.

They look: a blue light is flashing outside - clearly a
police car is parked below.

Feet thumping on the stairs, and suddenly in the doorway -DI Lestrade.

SHERLOCK
Where?

LESTRADE
Brixton. Lauriston Gardens.

SHERLOCK
What's different about this one.
You wouldn't have come to get me,
if there wasn’t something new.

LESTRADE
You know how they never leave
notes?

SHERLOCK
Yeah.

LESTRADE

This one did. Will you come?
Sherlock just looks at him. Tempted now, interested.

SHERLOCK
+++ Who’s on Forensics?

LESTRADE
Anderson.

SHERLOCK
Anderson won't work with me.

LESTRADE
He won't be your assistant.

SHERLOCK
But I need an assistant.

LESTRADE
Will you come?

SHERLOCK
Not in a police car. I'll be right
behind you.

LESTRADE
Thankyou!

A cursory nod at Mrs. Hudson, and John, and he’s gone.

233A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

John is thunderstruck - a cat at a tennis match. Mrs. Hudson
just looks faintly knowing.

And Sherlock lets a whoop of excitement.

SHERLOCK
Brilliant!

He leaps right over the sofa, dashes to his desk, starts
stuffing things in his pockets - his kit.

SHERLOCK
And I thought it was going to be a
boring evening. Serial suicides,
and now a note ~ oh, it’s
Christmas!

(Dashes for the door)
Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late - might
need some food.

MRS. HUDSON
I’m your landlady, dear, not your
housekeeper.

SHERLOCK

Something cold is fine. John make
yourself at home - have a cuppa!
Don’t wait up!

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

MRS. HUDSON
(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third
“Suicide’ found” there’s a photograph.

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down
type, I can tell. 1/11 make you
that cuppa, you rest your leg.

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

JOHN

I'm sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s just
sometimes’... bloody thing.

JOHN:
A cup of tea would be lovely, thank
you.

MRS. HUDSON

(Heading for the door)
Just this once, dear - I’m not your
housekeeper.

John is settling down on the sofa - disconsolate, annoyed at
himself.

JOHN
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got them.

MRS. HUDSON

Not your housekeeper.

John, sitting there, frowning: Sherlock Holmes - who the hell
is he?

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

SHERLOCK
(From off)
You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

SHERLOCK

Seen a lot of injuries then.
Violent deaths?

25.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

JOHN
Well, yes.

SHERLOCK
Bit of trouble too, I bet.

JOHN
Of course, yes. Enough for a
lifetime. Far too much.
They stand facing each other for a moment. Sherlock,
considering. John, not quite knowing what he’s waiting for,
but it’s coming.

SHERLOCK
Want to see some more?

JOHN
(Blurts out of him)
Oh, God, yes!

And he's dashing for the door again --- John hesitates for a second --- and for the first time ever dashes after him.

Something slightly dazed and pained in his’eyes. He's been

He reaches for the pill bottle. His hands are shaking

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

REPORTER
Sorry, I 
SALLY
If you've all got texts, please
ignore them.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

REPORTER
It just says “Wrong”

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

18/04/10

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

Close on Sally, reading the signs - Lestrade is
getting cross.

LESTRADE
(Quick course correction)
Obviously this is a frightening
time for people, but all anyone has
to do is exercise reasonable
precautions. We are all as safe as
we want to be.

A moment of frantic scribbling - good quote! - and then a

Lestrade has slammed into his office, heading straight to his

He speaks lightly and casually, knowing there’s someone there
to hear.

I was thinking of a pipe. What do
pipes do for you cigarettes don’t?

A beat - and a cultured voice from off.

Cancer of the jaw.

Lestrade laughs, looks round. A tall, thin man is standing
with his back to us right at the edge of the roof, looking
out over London. A silhouette.

LESTRADE
Okay. What am I getting wrong this
time?

SHERLOCK

No notes. No prior sign. Each of
them in a strange location that
means nothing to them where they’ve
never gone before... That’s not

On Miss. Hooper watching. Perhaps a girlish flutter.
Sherlock appears in shot, tossing the riding crop aside.

MIKE
What’s wrong with the landline?

SHERLOCK

Sherlock has swivelled round in his chair -

jacket and is proffering his phone (a rather swish smart
phone - but NOT an iPhone.)

SHERLOCK

Oh, thank you.

happened to the lipstick?

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER

SHERLOCK

She stares at him. He’s still completely oblivious to the
effect he’s having, texting away.

MISS. HOOPER

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each
other.

John, flummoxed - looks to Mike.

JOHN
Oh! You told him about me?

Mike has been watching this with a knowing air. Enjoying the
routine.

MIKE
Not a word.

JOHN
.++ then who said anything about
flatmates?

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this
morning, that I was a difficult man
to finda flatmate for. Now he
turns up after lunch with an old
friend Clearly just home from
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn’t a difficult leap.

JOHN
«++ how did you know about
Afghanistan?

But Sherlock isn’t really listening. He’s logging out of the

computer, pulling on his jacket.

SHERLOCK
I’ve got my eye on a nice little
place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

(Heading for the door)

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

JOHN
Is that it?

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I
don’t even know where we’re

John is thunderstruck - a cat at a tennis match. Mrs. Hudson
just looks faintly knowing.

And Sherlock lets a whoop of excitement.

SHERLOCK
Brilliant!

He leaps right over the sofa, dashes to his desk, starts
stuffing things in his pockets - his kit.

SHERLOCK
And I thought it was going to be a
boring evening. Serial suicides,
and now a note ~ oh, it’s

Something cold is fine. John make
yourself at home - have a cuppa!
Don’t wait up!

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

MRS. HUDSON
(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down

apologies.

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

letting his breathing return to normal.

Dr. John Watson. Early thirties, thickset, weathered.
Something slightly dazed and pained in his’eyes. He's been
through hard times, seen bad things.

Looks around the room. A bare minimum of personal
possessions, neatly folded clothes.

The opposite wall. Leaning by the door, a walking cane.

Close on John, looking at it - frowns. Fierce, resentful.

Later - first light. Close on a coffee cup as it is set down
on the desk. Panning down the desk drawer as John pulls it
open, removes a laptop computer -

(whatever gun John would've had in Afghanistan.)

John's look holds on the gun for a moment, like it’s a
curious temptation to him -
-- then he firmly closes the drawer.

The lap top computer open at:

A blog page. Closer on the Page Title:

He reaches for the pill bottle. His hands are shaking
violently he can barely undo the top.

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.
Can't quite grasp that he’s really going to do this —

- and he slams the pill into his mouth, bites down on it.

For a moment, nothing. And under this a voice - tremulous,
tearful.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

REPORTER

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

18/04/10

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

Close on Sally, reading the signs - Lestrade is
getting cross.

to do is exercise reasonable
precautions. We are all as safe as
we want to be.

Lestrade laughs, looks round. A tall, thin man is standing

(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third
“Suicide’ found” there’s a photograph.

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

JOHN

I'm sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s just

JOHN:

MRS. HUDSON

(Heading for the door)
Just this once, dear - I’m not your

John is settling down on the sofa - disconsolate, annoyed at
himself.

JOHN
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got them.

MRS. HUDSON

Not your housekeeper.

John, sitting there, frowning: Sherlock Holmes - who the hell
is he?

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

SHERLOCK
(From off)
You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

SHERLOCK

Seen a lot of injuries then.
Violent deaths?

Well, yes.

SHERLOCK
Bit of trouble too, I bet.

JOHN
Of course, yes. Enough for a

but it’s coming.

SHERLOCK
Want to see some more?

Oh, God, yes!

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

Don't commit suicide.

Hi.

John looks round. Sherlock has just climbed out of a cab,
and is now paying the cabbie.

JOHN
Mr. Holmes!

SHERLOCK
Sherlock, please.

JOHN
Prime spot. Got to be expensive.

He's ringing the doorbell on 221b.

The room is fairly large and pleasant - and a dreadful mess.
Stacks of newspapers, several computers, a tumble of box
files along the shelves, books everywhere, a terrifying
collection of what look’like weapons, a skull on the
mantlepiece. An adjoining kitchen, the table crammed with
testubes and jars and bunsen burners.

JOHN
Well! This could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.

Yes, I think so. My thoughts

Oh, Sherlock, the mess you've made.

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN
Looked you up on the Internet last
night.

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN
Found your website - The Science of
Deduction.

SHERLOCK

What did you think?

JOHN
You said you could identify a
software designer by his tie, and
an airline pilot by his left’ thumb.

SHERLOCK
Yes. And I can read your military
career in your face and your leg,
and the drinking habits of your
brother in your mobile phone.

JOHN
How?

Mrs. Hudson has been bustling about, straightening up. She's

picked up a newspaper from the floor.

MRS. HUDSON
What about these suicides, then,
Sherlock? Thought that would be
right up your street. Three of
them, exactly the same. That’s a
bit funny, isn’t it?

On Sherlock, staring, like he’s sensing something in the air.

SHERLOCK

Four. There’s been a fourth. And
there's something different this
time.

MRS. HUDSON
A fourth? How do you know?
For answer, he points to the window.

They look: a blue light is flashing outside - clearly a
police car is parked below.

Feet thumping on the stairs, and suddenly in the doorway -DI Lestrade.

SHERLOCK
Where?

LESTRADE
Brixton. Lauriston Gardens.

SHERLOCK
What's different about this one.
You wouldn't have come to get me,
if there wasn’t something new.

SHERLOCK
Yeah.

Sherlock just looks at him. Tempted now, interested.

SHERLOCK

SHERLOCK
Anderson won't work with me.

LESTRADE
He won't be your assistant.

SHERLOCK
But I need an assistant.

SHERLOCK
Not in a police car. I'll be right

LESTRADE
Thankyou!

A cursory nod at Mrs. Hudson, and John, and he’s gone.

233A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

John is thunderstruck - a cat at a tennis match. Mrs. Hudson
just looks faintly knowing.

And Sherlock lets a whoop of excitement.

SHERLOCK
Brilliant!

He leaps right over the sofa, dashes to his desk, starts
stuffing things in his pockets - his kit.

SHERLOCK
And I thought it was going to be a
boring evening. Serial suicides,
and now a note ~ oh, it’s
Christmas!

(Dashes for the door)
Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late - might
need some food.

MRS. HUDSON
I’m your landlady, dear, not your
housekeeper.

SHERLOCK

Something cold is fine. John make
yourself at home - have a cuppa!
Don’t wait up!

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

MRS. HUDSON
(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third
“Suicide’ found” there’s a photograph.

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down
type, I can tell. 1/11 make you
that cuppa, you rest your leg.

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

JOHN

I'm sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s just
sometimes’... bloody thing.

JOHN:

MRS. HUDSON

Just this once, dear - I’m not your
housekeeper.

John is settling down on the sofa - disconsolate, annoyed at
himself.

JOHN
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got them.

MRS. HUDSON

Not your housekeeper.

John, sitting there, frowning: Sherlock Holmes - who the hell
is he?

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

SHERLOCK
(From off)
You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

SHERLOCK

Seen a lot of injuries then.
Violent deaths?

JOHN
Well, yes.

SHERLOCK
Bit of trouble too, I bet.

JOHN
Of course, yes. Enough for a

They stand facing each other for a moment. Sherlock,

but it’s coming.

SHERLOCK
Want to see some more?

Oh, God, yes!

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior

late last night on a building site

to hear.

LESTRADE
Trying to give these up actually.

I was thinking of a pipe. What do
pipes do for you cigarettes don’t?

A beat - and a cultured voice from off.

SHERLOCK
(From off)
Cancer of the jaw.

Lestrade laughs, looks round. A tall, thin man is standing
with his back to us right at the edge of the roof, looking
out over London. A silhouette.

LESTRADE
Okay. What am I getting wrong this
time?

SHERLOCK

No notes. No prior sign. Each of
them in a strange location that
means nothing to them where they’ve
never gone before... That’s not
how I‘d kill myself.

On Lestrade. Glances uneasily at the edge of the roof, where
Sherlock is standing.

LESTRADE
++. So. How are you doing these
days?
CUT TO:

On John’s stick and limping leg, as he hobbles along.

John keeps grimly, determinedly on.

We hear a voice is shouting.

MIKE
John!

Watson ignores the voice, limping doggedly on.

MIKE
John Watson!

He turns. A plump, suited man of about Watson’s age grabbing
John’s hand, pumping it.

MIKE
Stamford - Mike Stamford, we were
at Barts together.

JOHN
Yes. Sorry, yes, Mike, hello!

MIKE
Yes, I know, I got fat. I heard you
were abroad somewhere getting shot
at. What happened?

JOHN
I got shot.

EXT. PARK - DAY 17

Mike and John turning from a Cappuccino stand, with their
coffees. (The Criterion Cappuccino Stand.) Mike can’t help
glancing at John’s stick.

MIKE
You okay?

JOHN
Just my leg.

MIKE
Bad, is it?

JOHN
My therapist thinks it’s
psychosomatic.

MIKE

What do you think?

JOHN
I think I got shot.

As they settle at a table...

JOHN
You're still at Barts then?

MIKE
Teaching now - bright young things,
like we used to be. God, I hate
them. What about you? Staying in
town till you get yourself sorted?

JOHN

MIKE
And you couldn't bear to be
anywhere else. Not the John Watson
I know!

JOHN
I’m not the John Watson you -
He bites that answer off. Doesn’t want to get into all that.
He raises his Cappuccino for a sip, but as he lifts it (in
his left hand) his hand is shaking’ badly. He's aware that
Mike is staring at it. Just sets it down again. Does NOT
want to get into this.

MIKE
Couldn't Harry help?

John just gives him a look.

JOHN
Yeah, that’s going to happen.

MIKE
Well I don’t know - get a flatshare
or something?

JOHN
Who'd want me for a flatmate?

Mike gives a little laugh.

JOHN
What?

MIKE
You're the second person to say
that to me today.

John looks at him, intrigued in spite of himself.

JOHN
Who was the first?

INT. ST BARTHOLEMEW'S/DISSECTING ROOMS - DAY 18
For a moment blackness, the zzzziiiippp.

A drip is drawn down the centre of the screen, splitting the
darkness on a thin face staring down at us - Clinical,
fascinated, and from our POV upside down. This is Sherlock
Holmes.

SHERLOCK
How fresh?

Wider. Sherlock stands over a body bag lying on dissection
table. He has just unzipped it to inspect the contents.

Sherlock: early thirties, tall, lean, imperious. He is
plainly but neatly dressed.

Next to him, Miss. Hooper: lab-coated, clearly works here.
MISS. HOOPER
Just in. 67, natural causes. Used
to work here, donated his body. I
knew him. He was nice.

Sherlock turns into a hero close-up.

SHERLOCK
Fine. We'll start with the riding
crop.
cUT TO:
INT. ST BARTHOLEMEW’S/DISSECTING ROOMS - DAY 19

Few minutes later: on Miss. Hooper, watching from the side of
the room. Sherlock’s shadows flap over the wall, huge and
terrifying. He’s slashing at the dissecting table with the
riding crop. Whack!! Whack!! Whack!!

On Miss. Hooper watching. Perhaps a girlish flutter.
Sherlock appears in shot, tossing the riding crop aside.

MISS. HOOPER
So. Bad day, was it?

Sherlock ignores her little joke, is making notes on a pad.

SHERLOCK
I need to know what bruises form in
the next twenty minutes. Text me.

MISS. HOOPER
Listen, I was wondering, maybe
later, when you're finished -
SHERLOCK
Are you wearing lipstick? You
weren't wearing lipstick before.

MISS. HOOPER
I just ... refreshed it a bit.

SHERLOCK
Sorry, you were saying?

MISS. HOOPER
I was wondering if you’d like to
have coffee?

SHERLOCK

Black, two sugars, please I'll be
upstairs.

Sherlock at his laptop, tapping away. On his fingers typing so fast, like a’machine.

From the other end of the room:

The door opening, voices. Beyond Sherlock we see John and
Mike coming into the room.

JOHN
Bit different from my day.

MIKE
You've no idea.

Without glancing up from his computer:
SHERLOCK
Mike, can I borrow your phone? No
signal on mine.

MIKE
What’s wrong with the landline?

SHERLOCK
I'd rather text.

Mike has reached inside his jacket -
MIKE
Sorry. Other coat.

JOHN
Here. Use mine

Sherlock has swivelled round in his chair -
=- to see John Watson, who has already reached into his
jacket and is proffering his phone (a rather swish smart
phone - but NOT an iPhone.)

SHERLOCK
(Taking it)
Oh, thank you.
MIKE
This is an old friend of mine John Watson.

Sherlock has barely glanced at John, is now texting away on
his phone.

15.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

SHERLOCK
Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN
se. I'm sorry?

SHERLOCK
Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq?

JOHN
+. Afghanistan. I’m sorry, how
did you -
He's interrupted as Molly Hooper comes through the door,
bearing coffee.

SHERLOCK
Coffee! Thank you, Molly! What
happened to the lipstick?

Setting down the coffee, Molly colours again.

MISS. HOOPER
It ... wasn’t working for me.

SHERLOCK

Really? I thought it was a big
improvement - mouth’s too small
now.

She stares at him. He’s still completely oblivious to the
effect he’s having, texting away.

MISS. HOOPER
ses okay.

With a shy little nod at the other two men, she goes.
Sherlock tosses the phone back to John.

SHERLOCK
How do you feel about the violin?

JOHN
I’m sorry, what?

SHERLOCK
I play the violin when I'm
thinking, and sometimes I don’t
talk for’days on end - would that
bother you? Potential flatmates
should know the worst about each
other.

John, flummoxed - looks to Mike.

JOHN
Oh! You told him about me?

Mike has been watching this with a knowing air. Enjoying the
routine.

16.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

MIKE
Not a word.

JOHN
.++ then who said anything about
flatmates?

SHERLOCK
I did. I said to Mike this
morning, that I was a difficult man
to finda flatmate for. Now he
turns up after lunch with an old
friend Clearly just home from
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn’t a difficult leap.

JOHN
«++ how did you know about
Afghanistan?

18/04/10

But Sherlock isn’t really listening. He’s logging out of the

computer, pulling on his jacket.

SHERLOCK
I’ve got my eye on a nice little
place in central London - together
we could afford it. We’ll meet
there, tomorrow evening, 7 o’clock.

(Heading for the door)

Sorry, got to dash - I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

JOHN
Is that it?

SHERLOCK
Is that what?

JOHN
We've just met and we’re going to
go and look at a flat??

SHERLOCK
Problem?

JOHN
We don’t know a thing about each
other. I don’t know your name. I
don’t even know where we’re
meeting!

Sherlock looks at him, a tiny smile - he loves this part.

SHERLOCK
I know you’re an army doctor and
you've been invalided home from
Afghanistan.

SHERLOCK (cont'd)
I know you've got a brother with a
bit of money who's worried about
you, but you won't go to him for
help because you don’t approve of
him - possibly because he’s an
alcoholic, more likely because he
recently walked out on his wife.
And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp is psychosomatic quite correctly, I’m afraid.
That’s enough to be going on with,
don’t you think?

John is staring at him. Utter astonishment. What? What??

Sherlock has turned on his heel, and is walking out the door.
He turns

SHERLOCK
The name's Sherlock Holmes and the
address is 221b Baker Street.
Afternoon.

He goes.

Hi.

John looks round. Sherlock has just climbed out of a cab,
and is now paying the cabbie.

JOHN
Mr. Holmes!

SHERLOCK
Sherlock, please.

JOHN
Prime spot. Got to be expensive.

He's ringing the doorbell on 221b.

SHERLOCK
Mrs. Hudson, the landlady. she’s
giving me a’ special deal. Owes me
a favour - few years ago, her
husband got himself sentenced to
death in Florida. I was able to
help out.

John gives him on openly skeptical look. Who is this guy?

JOHN
You stopped her husband being
executed.

SHERLOCK

Oh, no. I ensured it.

Joyously she throws her arms rounds Sherlock.

INT. 221B BAKER STREET/SITTING ROOM - DAY 28

On the door, as it is opened. John steps into the room,
looking around - Sherlock behind him.

The room is fairly large and pleasant - and a dreadful mess.
Stacks of newspapers, several computers, a tumble of box
files along the shelves, books everywhere, a terrifying
collection of what look’like weapons, a skull on the
mantlepiece. An adjoining kitchen, the table crammed with
testubes and jars and bunsen burners.

JOHN
Well! This could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.

SHERLOCK
Yes, I think so. My thoughts
exactly.
JOHN SHERLOCK
Soon as we get all this So I went ahead and moved in.

rubbish cleaned out.

They look at each other. Oh!

JOHN
So, this is all -
SHERLOCK
Obviously I can straighten things
up a bit.

JOHN

That’s a skull

SHERLOCK
Friend of mine. Well I say friend

Mrs. Hudson comes bustling in.

MRS. HUDSON
What do you think, Dr. Watson —
there’s another bedroom upstairs.
(Knowing look)
If you'll be needing two bedrooms

John looks at her, a little affronted.

21.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED

JOHN
Well of course we'll be needing
two.

MRS. HUDSON
Oh don’t you worry, all sorts round
here. Mrs. Turner next door’s got
married ones.
(Looking around)
Oh, Sherlock, the mess you've made.

18/04/10

She bustles into the kitchen area, tidying as she goes.

Sherlock is busying himself at his desk. John eyes him

thoughtfully. After a moment:

JOHN
Looked you up on the Internet last
night.

SHERLOCK
Anything interesting?

JOHN
Found your website - The Science of
Deduction.

SHERLOCK

What did you think?

JOHN
You said you could identify a
software designer by his tie, and
an airline pilot by his left’ thumb.

SHERLOCK
Yes. And I can read your military
career in your face and your leg,
and the drinking habits of your
brother in your mobile phone.

JOHN
How?

Mrs. Hudson has been bustling about, straightening up. She's

picked up a newspaper from the floor.

MRS. HUDSON
What about these suicides, then,
Sherlock? Thought that would be
right up your street. Three of
them, exactly the same. That’s a
bit funny, isn’t it?

On Sherlock, staring, like he’s sensing something in the air.

SHERLOCK

Four. There’s been a fourth. And
there's something different this
time.

225A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10
MRS. HUDSON
A fourth? How do you know?
For answer, he points to the window.

They look: a blue light is flashing outside - clearly a
police car is parked below.

Feet thumping on the stairs, and suddenly in the doorway -DI Lestrade.

SHERLOCK
Where?

LESTRADE
Brixton. Lauriston Gardens.

SHERLOCK
What's different about this one.
You wouldn't have come to get me,
if there wasn’t something new.

LESTRADE
You know how they never leave
notes?

SHERLOCK
Yeah.

LESTRADE

This one did. Will you come?
Sherlock just looks at him. Tempted now, interested.

SHERLOCK
+++ Who’s on Forensics?

LESTRADE
Anderson.

SHERLOCK
Anderson won't work with me.

LESTRADE
He won't be your assistant.

SHERLOCK
But I need an assistant.

LESTRADE
Will you come?

SHERLOCK
Not in a police car. I'll be right
behind you.

LESTRADE
Thankyou!

A cursory nod at Mrs. Hudson, and John, and he’s gone.

233A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

John is thunderstruck - a cat at a tennis match. Mrs. Hudson
just looks faintly knowing.

And Sherlock lets a whoop of excitement.

SHERLOCK
Brilliant!

He leaps right over the sofa, dashes to his desk, starts
stuffing things in his pockets - his kit.

SHERLOCK
And I thought it was going to be a
boring evening. Serial suicides,
and now a note ~ oh, it’s
Christmas!

(Dashes for the door)
Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late - might
need some food.

MRS. HUDSON
I’m your landlady, dear, not your
housekeeper.

SHERLOCK

Something cold is fine. John make
yourself at home - have a cuppa!
Don’t wait up!

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

MRS. HUDSON
(To John, sympathetic)
Oh, look at him, dashing about? My
husband was just the same.

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third
“Suicide’ found” there’s a photograph.

Closer on the photograph - a snatched picture of the man who
just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down
type, I can tell. 1/11 make you
that cuppa, you rest your leg.

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

JOHN

I'm sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s just
sometimes’... bloody thing.

24.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

MRS. HUDSON
I understand, dear. I've got a
hip.

JOHN:
A cup of tea would be lovely, thank
you.

MRS. HUDSON

(Heading for the door)
Just this once, dear - I’m not your
housekeeper.

John is settling down on the sofa - disconsolate, annoyed at
himself.

JOHN
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got them.

MRS. HUDSON

Not your housekeeper.

John, sitting there, frowning: Sherlock Holmes - who the hell
is he?

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

SHERLOCK
(From off)
You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

SHERLOCK

Seen a lot of injuries then.
Violent deaths?

25.A STUDY IN PINK SHOOTING SCRIPT - GREEN AMENDED 18/04/10

JOHN
Well, yes.

SHERLOCK
Bit of trouble too, I bet.

JOHN
Of course, yes. Enough for a
lifetime. Far too much.
They stand facing each other for a moment. Sherlock,
considering. John, not quite knowing what he’s waiting for,
but it’s coming.

SHERLOCK
Want to see some more?

JOHN
(Blurts out of him)
Oh, God, yes!

SHERLOCK
Get your coat.

And he's dashing for the door again --- John hesitates for a second --- and for the first time ever dashes after him.

JOHN
What does that mean?

SHERLOCK
It means when the police are out of
their depth - which is always they consult me.

JOHN
But the police don’t consult -
Bites off the word. Sherlock looks sharply at him.

JOHN
Amateurs.

Just the merest flash in Sherlock’s eyes: didn’t like that.

SHERLOCK
When I first met you yesterday I
said, Afghanistan or Iraq? You
seemed surprised.

JOHN
How did you know?

And whoosh!

SHERLOCK

Your limp is really bad when you
walk, but you don’t ask for a chair
when you stand, like you've
forgotten about it - so it’s at
least partly psychosomatic. That
says the circumstances of the
original injury were traumatising wounded in action then.

In the cab:

JOHN
You said I had a therapist.

letting his breathing return to normal.

Dr. John Watson. Early thirties, thickset, weathered.
Something slightly dazed and pained in his’eyes. He's been
through hard times, seen bad things.

Looks around the room. A bare minimum of personal
possessions, neatly folded clothes.

The opposite wall. Leaning by the door, a walking cane.

Close on John, looking at it - frowns. Fierce, resentful.

He reaches for the pill bottle. His hands are shaking
violently he can barely undo the top.

Now he’s staring at the pill in his hand. Disbelieving.
Can't quite grasp that he’s really going to do this —

- and he slams the pill into his mouth, bites down on it.

For a moment, nothing. And under this a voice - tremulous,
tearful.

SALLY

The body of Beth Davenport, Junior
Minister for Transport, was found
late last night on a building site
in Greater London. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this
was suicide. We can confirm this
apparent suicide closely resembles
those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and
James Phillimore. In the light of
this, these incidents are now being
treated as linked. The
investigation is on-going, but
Detective Inspector Lestrade will
take questions now.

A blizzard of questions, but one Reporter, louder than the
others.

REPORTER
Detective Inspector, how can
suicides be linked?

LESTRADE
They all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they
had no reason to be, none of them
had shown any prior indication of -
REPORTER
But you can’t have serial suicides.

LESTRADE
Apparently you can.

SECOND REPORTER
These three people - there’s
nothing that links them?

LESTRADE
There’s no link we've found yet,
but we're looking for it - there
has to be one.

There’s a flurry of writing in notebooks - and then there’s a
whole chorus of chirps and beeps - not quite in sync, but
almost. It’s like every mobile in the room received 4 text at
once.

Everyone - even Sally - is checking their phones.

Not Lestrade - he just rolls his eyes. Been here before.

The Reporter has pulled his phone out,

SALLY

Yeah, well just ignore that.

If there are no more questions for
Detective Inspector Lestrade, I’m
going to bring this session to an
end.

SECOND REPORTER
If they’re suicides, what are you
investigating?

LESTRADE
As I say, these suicides are
clearly linked, this is an unusual
situation, and’we have our best
people investigating.

Almost immediately, another chorus of chirps and bleeps.

They’re all looking at their phones again.

REPORTER
Says “Wrong” again.

Lestrade and Sally exchange furious glance.

SALLY
One more question.

FEMALE REPORTER
Is there any chance these are
murders, and if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

LESTRADE
I know you like writing about
those, but these do appear to be
suicides. We know the difference the poison was clearly selfadministered.

FEMALE REPORTER
Yes, but if they are murders, how
do people keep themselves safe?

LESTRADE
Don't commit suicide.

Close on Sally, reading the signs - Lestrade is
getting cross.

we want to be.

And he's bounded out the door. John looks after him,
slightly bemused. He grabs the newspaper again.

Oh, look at him, dashing about? My

John is looking at the paper. Under the headline “Third

just left (Lestrade). Panning down to the words “Inspector
Lestrade, in charge of the investigation”.

MRS. HUDSON

But you’re more the sitting down
type, I can tell. 1/11 make you
that cuppa, you rest your leg.

A sudden flash of anger from John - he dashes down the paper.

JOHN
Damn my leg!

She looks startled - John is instantly in raptures of
apologies.

JOHN

I'm sorry, I’m so sorry, it’s just
sometimes’... bloody thing.

MRS. HUDSON
I understand, dear. I've got a
hip.

JOHN:
A cup of tea would be lovely, thank
you.

MRS. HUDSON

(Heading for the door)
Just this once, dear - I’m not your
housekeeper.

John is settling down on the sofa - disconsolate, annoyed at
himself.

JOHN
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got them.

MRS. HUDSON

Not your housekeeper.

John, sitting there, frowning: Sherlock Holmes - who the hell
is he?

Pulls his phone out his jacket, turns it over in his hand,
examines it. And how did he do that?

SHERLOCK
(From off)
You're a doctor.

John startles, turn.

Sherlock is back, leaning in the doorway, looking at him
thoughtfully.

SHERLOCK
In fact, you're an army doctor.

JOHN
Yes.

Sherlock is moving into the room, look hard at John,
speculating.

SHERLOCK
Any good?

JOHN
Very good.

John has found himself standing up - doesn’t quite know why,
like there’s something momentous happening. And it’s almost
like he’s standing to attention.

SHERLOCK

Seen a lot of injuries then.
Violent deaths?

JOHN
Well, yes.

SHERLOCK
Bit of trouble too, I bet.

JOHN
Of course, yes. Enough for a
lifetime. Far too much.
They stand facing each other for a moment. Sherlock,
considering. John, not quite knowing what he’s waiting for,
but it’s coming.

SHERLOCK
Want to see some more?

JOHN
(Blurts out of him)
Oh, God, yes!

SHERLOCK
Get your coat.

And he's dashing for the door again --- John hesitates for a second --- and for the first time ever dashes after him.

cur TO:

29 INT. 221B BAKER STREET/EXIT STAIRS - DAY 29
Sherlock and John clattering down the stairs.

Mrs. Hudson pokes her head out of the door at the foot of the
stairs.

JOHN
Sorry, Mrs. Hudson, I'll skip the
cuppa - off out.

MRS. HUDSON
Both of you?

SHERLOCK
Impossible suicides - four of them.
No point in sitting at home when
there’s finally something fun going

ont!
MRS. HUDSON

Look at you, all happy. It’s not

decent.
