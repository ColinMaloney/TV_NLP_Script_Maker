Service. Why come to me?

 

‘THE BQUERRY
People do come to you for help, don't
they, Mr. Holmes?

SHERLOCK
Not, to date, anyone with a navy.

MYCROFT
This is a matter of the highest
security, and therefore of trust.

JORN
You don't trust your own secret
MycROFT

Naturally not. They all spy on people
for money.

SHERLOCK
Fair point.

ORK
But it's Sherlock you want - what am
I doing here?

‘THE EQUERRY
I did wonder myself, Mycroft.

MycRoFT
My baby brother is a genius in his
chosen field. But in this case, we
need a genius with a conscience ~
which, typically, my brother has
outsourced.

 

JOHN
oh, great. I'm Jiminy cricket.

The Holmes brothers both laugh - a rare moment of bonding.

MycROFT
Actually, that rather works.2s.

SHERLOCK

Tt does, doesn't it?

‘THE EQUERRY
(sharply)

I do think we have a timetable.

MYCROFT
of course, yes.

He has taken an ENVELOPE from his CASE, now slides a

What do you know about this woman?

Hardly a difficult deduction.

delicately sets it down.

As we watch, various items of clothing are tossed through
Sherlock's open door - a SOLDIER'S UNIFORM, WORKMAN'S
OVERALLS = as each is rejected. A TUXEDO joins the pile.

JOHN
What are you doing?

Sherlock appears through the door, with a policeman's jacket
slung over his normal clothes.

SHERLOCK
I'm going into battle, John. Need the
right armour.

He disappears back into his room, pulling the jacket off.

Kate's face - amused.

KATE
I could phone the police, if you
want.

Yes, please, if you could. Do you
mind if T just wait out here?

on screen, he straightens up slightly = reveal that he's wearing a clerical collar.

on Kate's face - oh, he's pretending to be a vicar. A knowing
smirk - which she hides as she starts opening the door —

helping hin.

And before she can stop them, they're through the door.

IND. IRENE'S LIVING ROOM ~ pay

 

A sumptuous, and very respectable, living room. Sherlock,
Slone, is perched on the end of a sofa, dabbing at his
Bruised face.

We hear a door open behind him.

Hello, sorry to hear you've been

hurt, I'don't think Kate caught your

Sherlock, getting hurriedly to his feet.

SHERLOCK
Yes, sorry, I'm 
and he breaks off. For the first time ever, we see all the
brakes jan on in his brain as he just stares.a7.

Because IRENE ADLER is standing in front of him, entirely
naked. (NB. This shot for pre-watershed. We know she is naked
but we don't see anything. Like Sherlock, we always manage to
avert our eyes.)

Irene is just smiling at him now.

IRENE ADLER
ob it's always so hard to remenber an
alias when you've just had a fright,

She steps lightly forward, plucks off his clerical collar.
IRENE ADLER
There now, we're both defrocked - Mr.
Sherlock Holmes.

SHERLOCK
Irene Adler, I presume.

on Sherlock: on the back foot for once. And now she's running
a finger along one of his cheekbones.

 

IRENE ADLER
Look at these cheekbones. I think I
coula cut my hand slapping your face.
Would you like me to try?

With an impish smile, she pops the clerical collar in her
mouth, snapping her teeth shut on it.

= just as John enters (bowl, towel, the cuts and bruises
paraphernalia you find in any bathroom)

ORK
Right then, so...

And he stops dead at what he sees: Sherlock, fact to face
with a naked wonan, who has his clerical collar in her teeth.

JORN
okay. Missed something, did 1?

 

Irene just smiles. Without a care in the world, she heads
over to the other sofa, settles down on it. (Perhaps she
picks up a cushion at this point - just to make the scene
Shootable.)

IRENE ADLER
Please, eit down, if you'd like some
tea, I'11 call the maid.

SHERLOCK
had some at the Palace.ae.

IRENE ADLER
1 know.

SHERLOCK
clearly.

Sherlock and Irene, now sitting on opposite - burning the air
between them, with’ staring.

John, feeling very out of it:
JORN

T had a tea at the palace too. If
anyone's interested.

 

IRENE ADLER
(Doesn't even glance at him)
Did he take sugar?

On Sherlock - something troubling him.

Sherlock's POV. On Irene, just sitting there. As he glances
over to John we see the normal swirl of words round him (TWO
DAY SHIRT. ELECTRIC NOT BLADE. HAD A LARGE CAPPUCINO. DATE
TONIGHT. HASN'T PHONED SISTER. NEW TOOTHBRUSH. NIGHT OUT WITH
STAMFORD.) but when he looks back to Irene 
~ nothing.
He blinks. Nothing.
Blinks again. Nothing.

IRENE ADLER
(fosses the dog collar in her hand)
Do you know the big problem with
disguise, Mr. Holmes? However hard
you try, it's always a self-portrait.

SHERLOCK
You think I'm a vicar with a bleeding
face?

IRENE ADLER

I think you're damaged, delusional,
and believe in a higher power —
though in your case, it's yourself.
And somebody loves you.

on Sherlock - a flicker of confusion.
IRENE ADLER
I I had to punch you in the face I'd
try to avoid your teeth and your nose

Her eyes to flash like lasers to John ~ who just bridles.39.

JORN
could you put something on, please?
Anything at all ~ a napkin:

IRENE ADLER
Why - are you feeling exposed?

Sherlock pulls his coat, from where it's lying on the sofa
next to him. He tosses it over to Irene.

SHERLOCK
I don't think John knows where to
Look.

Irene, now pulling the coat on.

IRENE. ADLER
oh, I think he knows exactly where.
Tim not sure about you.

SHERLOCK
If I wanted to look at naked women,
I'd borrow his laptop.

JOHN
You do borrow my laptop.

SHERLOCK
I confiscate it.

IRENE ADLER
Never mind all that, we've got better
things to talk about. Zell me, 1 need
fo know ~ how was it done.

SHERLOCK

IRENE ADLER

How was he killed?

Sherlock and John exchanging a look - what?

SHERLOCK
That's not why I'm here.

IRENE ADLER
No, you're here for the photographs.
But you're never going to get them,

50 seeing as we're chatting anyway...

On Sherlock - something new here. Something he's not quite in
control of. But he's keeping it calm, staying impassive.40.

JORN
That story hasn't even been on the
news. How do you know about it?

IRENE, ADLER
I know one of the policemen. Well - I
iknow what he Likes.

JORN
What, and you like policemen?

IRENE ADLER
I Like detective stories. And
detectives. Brainy - it's the new
sexy.

SHERLOCK
The position of the car.

John and Irene look at him. What?

SHERLOCK
The position of the car, relative to
the hiker, at the time of the
backfire. That plus the fact that the
death blow was on the back of his
head. All the information you need.

IRENE ADLER
Okay, tell me, How was he murdered?
SHERLOCK
He wasn't
IRENE ADLER
You don't think it was murder.
SHERLOCK
1 know it wasn't.
IRENE ADLER
How?
SHERLOCK

The same way I know the victim was an
excellent sportsman, recently
returned from foreign travel. And
that the photographs I'm looking for
are in this room.

IRENE ADLER
okay, but how?an.

SHERLOCK
(Springing to his feet)

So they are in this room ~ thank you!

John, outside, man the door, let no

John is already heading to the door.
As he passes, Sherlock the tiniest look of complicity flashes
between them. They're up to something, and this is part of
the plan ~

On Irene: what's going on?

John emerging from the room, closing the door. Looks around,

several yards apart, and one car.

 

IRENE ADLER

SHERLOCK
oh, no, looking takes ages! I'm just

Feally swanning about Irene's room, but stitched into the
flashback. )

SHERLOCK
Any moment now something's going to
happen. What?

We cut to Trene, still sitting on the sofa - but now the sofa
is SITING IN THE THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD. Beyond her, we
can see Phil in the car.

 

 

IRENE ADLER
The hiker's going to die.
SHERLOCK
No. that's the result. What's going

IRENE ADLER
E don't understand.
SHERLOCK
Try to.
IRENE ADLER

IRENE ADLER
the car's going to backfire.

 

SHERLOCK
There's going to be loud noise.

IRENE ADLER
So what?

SHERLOCK
oh, noises are important. Noises can
tell you everything. For instance
And the beep-beep-beep-beep-beep. The shrill of smoke alarm.
Super fast zoom on Sherlock's eyes. Stylised slow-motion, as
they swivel to look at Irene with @ big, slamming sound
effect.

SHERLOCK
Thank you

Sherlock start striding towards the mirror.

SHERLOCK

He slides the mirror to one side, revealing a safe built into
the wall, with a keypad on it.

SHERLOCK
I really hope you don't have a baby

John looks round.
Three men standing in the hallway now. Big, black suite,
square-jawed — traditional men in black, NEILSON, Tranter,

Sherlock, examining the keypad.

SHERLOCK
You should use a glove on these

Tranter takes Irene, Neilson walks among them, barking
orders.

NEILSON
Hands behind your head, on the floor,

JOHN
Sorry, Sherlock.

Archer stays behind John, gun leveled at his head. The other

We've been listening. she said she

told you.
SHERLOCK

If you've been listening, you know

she didn't.

He raises his gun slightly, so it's pointing directly at
Sherlock's forehead.

NEILSON
I'm assuming I missed something from your reputation, I'm assuming
you didn't - Kr. Holmes.46.

ORM
For God's sake, she’s the one who

IRENE ADLER

NEILSON
Shut up! one word out of you, just

Irene falls silent - looks to Sherlock. Something intense in

Neilson who is sprawled on the floor in front of him.

Similarly, Irene has Tranter’s gun aimed at him, as he's
Soublea up, fetching on the floor.

John is checking Archer.

JOHN
okay. He's dead.

 

They all look at each other. What do they do now?

Sherlock steps smartly over Neilson, clubs him from behind
with the gun butt. He falls limps.

SHERLOCK
(fo IRENE)
Would you mind?

IRENE ADLER
Not at all.

She moves to do the same to Archer. As che does so, Sherlock
glances towards the safe - there's a little leopard skin
object in there.

Thump! Archer hits the floor.

SHERLOCK
‘Thank you.

IRENE ADLER
Thank you ~ you're very
observant.

 

ORM
observant?

IRENE ADLER
i'm flattered.

SHERLOCK
(Striding from the room)
Don't be.

ORM
Flattered? Sorry, what?

He's following Sherlock from the room.49.

INT, HALLWAY OF IRENE'S HOUSE ~ DAY

 

Sherlock is striding for the front door.

SHERLOCK
There must he more of them - they'11
have back-up watching the house.

ORN
We should call the police.

SHERLOCK
ves.

Sherlock has opened the door. In one motion he yanks the
Silencer off the gun, and fires up into the sky. Slam! Blam!
Blam! Blan! Blam!

SHERLOCK
on their way.

ORN
oh, for God's sake.

SHERLOCK
Shut up, it's quick. Check the rest
of the house, see how they got in.

IND, IRENE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
IRENE is at the safe, looking inside for something.

SHERLOCK

(From off)
Well that’s the Knighthood in the

bag.

She spins. SHERLOCK, leaning in the doorway. He tosses
something in his hand.

Closer on it. A phone with a built in camera, blackberrystyle, but funkier. A leopard skin cover, a fetishists phone,
Something we'd instantly recognise.

IRENE ADLER
what's mine.

SHERLOCK
I take it they're all on here? The
photographs.

He presses 2 button.

Close on the screen ~50.

LOCKED

Four boxes appear in the centre of the screen, for the number
to be typed, so that it now appears

1AM

LOCKED

IRENE ADLER
I have other copies, of course.

SHERLOCK
No, you don't. You'll have
permanently disabled any kind of
Connection or uplink ~ unless the
contents of this phone are provably
unigue, you wouldn't be able to sell
them.

IRENE. ADLER
Who says I'm selling?

SHERLOCK

(Looking at the three prone men)
But why are they interested?
Whatever's on here, it's more than
just photographs

 

A cold stare from Irene. No flirtatiousness now, deadly

IRENE ADLER
It's my life, Mr. Holmes. My
protection.

SHERLOCK
qt was.

He tosses the phone in his hand again.
JORN
(Calling from)
Sherlock!

Sherlock heads away.

 

Irene: that cold stare for a moment - then starts to follow.

IND, IRENE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Irene's spectacular bedroom. The TALL WINDOWS stand open ~
JOHN is kneeling by Kate who's sprawled on the floor,si.

JORN
Mast have come in this way.

SHERLOCK
clearly.

IRENE is coming into the room now.

JOHN
She's okay, just out cold.

IRENE ADLER
Well God knows, she's used to that.
There's a back’ door ~ better check
it, Dr. Watson.

And she goes straight to her bedside table, rooting about in
it for something.

Sherlock and John exhange a glance. Blimey, she's cold.
Sherlock gives John a ned.

JOHN
sure.

John heads out.
SHERLOCK
You're very calm - your booby trap
just killed 2 man.
IRENE ADLER
Well he'd have killed me - it was
self-defence in advance.
And she turns with what's she taken from bedside cabinet ~

+ and slams 2 hypodermic into his arm. Sherlock shoots to his
feet.

SHERLOCK
What?? What have you - 77

He's reeling now, trying to grab the hypo from his arm. Irene
slaps him hard across the face.

IRENE ADLER
Give it to me.

He staggers against the wall - tries to get away from her.
She steps calmly forward, slaps him hard again.

IRENE ADLER
Now! Give it to me!

He reels avay from her, but clinging to consciousness,
gripping on to that damn cameraphone.52.

SHERLOCK
No!

IRENE ADLER
oh, for goodness sake!

She snatches up her riding crop from the bedside table - now
slashes at him, calm and expert. More lion-tamer, than
sadist.

IRENE ADLER
Drop it.

(slashes)
I said, drop iti

She cracks him across the back of the hand. He drops the
camera-phone, with a cry.

She kneels by him, picks up the camera phone, smiles.

IRENE ADLER
Thankyou, dear. Now tell that sweet
Little posh thing, the pictures are
safe with me. They're not for
Blackmail, just insurance. Besides ~
might want to see her again.

He makes a flailing grab for the camera-phone - she easily
avoids.

IRENE ADLER
No, no - it's been a pleasure, don't
spoil it.
(fickle him under the chin with her
crop)
This is how I want you to remember
me - the woman who beat you. Good
night, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

‘JOHN
Jesus!

John has just come back through the door, staring now.

JOHN
What are you doing?

Irene is already stepping to the window, starting to climb
out.

IRENE ADLER
He'll sleep for a few hours. Make
Sure he doesn't choke on his own
vonit, it makes for a very
unattractive corpse.

John, now finding the hypodermic -53.

ORM

What is this, what did you give him.
Sherlock??

IRENE ADLER
He'll be fine, I've used it an loads
of my friends.

‘JORN
Sherlock, can you hear me?

Irene, about to climb out the window, turns back for a
moment, contemplating Sherlock. He's still grimly clinging to
consciously, trying to sit up, fighting for breath.

IRENE ADLER
You know, I was wrong about him. He
did know where to look.

JORN
For what? What are you talking about?

IRENE ADLER
whe keycode to my safe.

JOHN
What was it?

IRENE ADLER
(fo Sherlock)
shall 1 tell him?
(A best - smiles at John)
My measurements

on John - obi
on Sherlock, losing the fight - he flops back on the floor.
we hold on him a moment, and then:

And then (a bit like with Phil the driver earlier) the camera

spins on its axis, as if turning Sherlock upright again and

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD ~ DAY

 

= this time it's SHERLOCK, mot Phil, sitting at the wheel. He
looks a little dazed, confused. The’ image is slightly,
twisted, distorted ~ dreamy.

And where Sherlock swanned past last time, this time it's
IRENE.

IRENE ADLER
Got it!sa.

Sherlock blinks confusedly at her.

IRENE ADLER
shh, now, don't get up. I'11 do the
talking. So the car's about to backfire vs. and the hiker...

She looks to the HIKER. We whip pan to:

The frozen HIKER, staring at the sky. We widen the shot to
include

SHERLOCK and IRENE, standing a few feet from him, observers
only. (Sherlock in’his normal suit, Irene now in Sherlock's
coat.)

IRENE ADLER

. ig staring at the sky. You said he
Gould be watching the birds ~ but he
wasn't, was he? He was watching
another kind of flying thing.

Bang!
IRENE ADLER
The car back-fires, the hiker turns
£0 Look.

The Hiker turn to look behind him .

 

Now from the POV of something flying through the air, superfast, towards the Hiker. We go slaming right into the back
of the Hiker's head, and the screen goes biack.

IRENE ADLER
Which was his big mistake ...

on Phil looking out his car, to see: Phil's POV. The Hiker
now lying dead.

IRENE ADLER
ay the tine the driver looks up, the
hiker is already dead. What he
doesn't see is what Killed him because it's fallen in the stream.

Shot from above the stream, bubbling along.

IRENE ADLER
(From off)

An accomplished sportsman recently

returned from foreign travel - with 2

boomerang.

And there, floating downstream, is a blood-stained boomerang.
We pan up'to see Sherlock and irene watching it float away.55.

IRENE ADLER
You got all that from one look.
Definitely the new sexy.

SHERLOCK
1 don't

 

Closer on Irene ~ now more stylised, she’s surrounded by
darkness.

IRENE ADLER

Bush now, it's okay.
(Kissing his check)

i'm only returning your coat.

IND. SHERLOCK'S BEDROOM ~ NIGHT
on Sherlock startling awake!
Where is he?? In his bed! How the hell did he get here??

SHERLOCK
Jobn! John!

He's trying to climb out of bed now, so unsteady on his feet,
‘drunken.

The door is opening, John is there.

JOHN
vou okay?

SHERLOCK
How did 1 get here?

JORN
I don't suppose you remember much,
you weren't making a lot of sense.
Should warn you, I think Lestrade
filmed you on his phone.

SHERLOCK
Where is she?

JOHN
Where's who?

SHERLOCK
She was here, the woman, that woman.

Sherlock is looking around wildly - clearly no one else is
here, But the window - just'a little open, curtain blowing in
the breeze.

oRN
What woman?56.

SHERLOCK
‘The woman - the woman woman.

JOHN

Irene Adler? She got away, no one saw
her - che wasn't here, Sherlock.

Sherlock is checking under his bed now. John is hauling him
back to his feet.

JOHN
Back in bed, you'll be fine in the
morning. Just sleep!

SHERLOCK
Yes, of course I'll be fine. I am
fine, I'm absolutely fine!

He's climbing unsteadily back into bed.

JORN
Yep, you are, you're just great. 1/11
be right next door if you need me.

SHERLOCK
Why would I need you?

JOHN
No reason at all

And John goes, closing the door.
= revealing something hanging on the hook on the back.

Sherlock doen't see it for a moment - then does. His coat —
returned.

He stares at it for a moment. How did that happen?

And then - a little orgasmic gasp. Definitely female. where
did that cone from?

On his coat - something is glowing. He steps groggily, and
retrieves his own phone from the own pocket. He's received a
text (the gasp was the text arriving.) He reads it.

TEXT ON SCREEN: Good night, Mr. Holmes.

On Sherlock's face, frowning at the text. In the faint light
of the phone, we sce a kiss of lipstick on his cheek.

INT, 2218 BAKER STREET - MORNING

on MvcROPT, irate.87.

MYCROFT
How about the foreign legion?

Mycroft is pacing the floor, furious. SHERLOCK and JOHN are
having their breakfast, doing their best to ignore him. MRS
HUDSON is cleaning up in the kitchen, and generally not being
& housekeeper.

MYCROFT
Does one still join the foreign
Legion, when in disgrace - what is
the modern form? Do you retire to the
study with a loaded revolver, or take
a job in Manchester?

SHERLOCK
‘he photographs are perfectly safe.

MycROFT

In the hands of a fugitive sex
worker?

SHERLOCK
She's not interested in blackmail - 1
think she just wants ...

protection, for some reason. I take
Tevyoa've stood down the police
investigation into the shooting at
her house?

MycRoFt
How we can do anything, while she has
those photographs? Our hands are
tied.

SHERLOCK
She would applaud your choice of
words. You see how it works? That
camera is her get-out-of-jail free
card, You have to leave her alone.
Treat her like royalty, Mycroft.

ORK
hough not the way she treats
royalty.
Sherlock laughs = and as he does there's a little orgasmic gasp. Everyone
startles a little. Sherlock just picks up his phone, glances
at it.
ON SCREEN TEXT: Good morning, Mr. Holmes.

ORK
What was that?se.

SHERLOCK
Just a text.

JOHN
But what was the noise?

SHERLOCK
Did you know there were other people
after her too. Before you sent Jonn
and me in there? CIA trained killers,
at an excellent guess.

JOHN
Yeah, cheers for that, Mycroft.

Mrs Hudson pipes up from the kitchen.

ms HUDSON
It's disgrace, sending your little
brother into danger like that.
Family's all we have in the end,
Mycroft Holmes!

MycROFT
oh, shut up, Mrs Hudson!

‘SHERLOCK gouN

(outraged) (outraged)
Mycroft! oi!

‘Two indignant stares, and Mycroft realises he's crossed a
Line.

MYCROFT
(fo Mrs Hudgon)
Apologies.

MRS HUDSON
Thankyou!

SHERLOCK
Though do, in fact, shut up.

Another little orgasmic gasp.

Rs HUDSON
oh, it's a bit rude, that noise,
fen'e it?

Sherlock absently checks his phone as he continues talking John watching him, curiously.

SHERLOCK
There's nothing you can do for now ~
and nothing she will do, as far I
Gnderstand.59.

During above:
ON SCREEN TEXT: Feeling better?

Sherlock puts the phone down again.

MYCROFT
1 can put maximum surveillance on
her.

SHERLOCK

Why bother - you can follow her on
twitter, I believe her user name is
The Whip Hand.

MYCROFT
Yes, most amusing - excuse me.

He's now answering his phone, which has been buzzing. He
steps away for a whispered conversation.

John has been dying to know:

ORK
Way does your phone make that noise?
SHERLOCK
What noise?
JOHN
what noise - the one it just made.
SHERLOCK
It's a text alert, It means I've got
a text.
JOHN
Your texte don't usually make that

Sherlock now studying the paper, really not wanting to get
into this

SHERLOCK
Well. Someone got hold of my phone,
and for a joke, apparently,

Personalised their text alert noise.

ORM
So every time they text you .

Another orgasmic gasp.

SHERLOCK
It would seem so.60.

MRS HUDSON
(From the kitchen, a little
flustered)

Could you turn that phone down a bit,

at my time of life.

He glances at the phone:
ON-SCREEN TEXT: I'm fine, since you didn't ask.

He lays aside the phone again - pointedly, face down. John,
looking at him, pondering. Maybe even smiling a bit.

JOHN
I'm just wondering who could have got
hold of your phone recently. Cos it

would've been in your coat, wouldn't
ie?

SHERLOCK
I leave you to your deductions.

ORM
I'm not stupid, you know.

SHERLOCK
Where do you get that idea?

He glances over at Mycroft, just concluding his call.

MycROFt
Bond Air is go, that's decided check with the Coventry lot. Talk
ister.

Mycroft clicking stepping over, phone call done. The moment
he clicks

SHERLOCK
What else does she have?

(Off Mycroft's frown)
Irene Adler. The Americans wouldn't
be interested in a few compromising
photographs, there's more. A lot
more. There's something big coming
isn't there?

MYCROFT
Irene Adler is no longer any concern
of yours. From now, you will stay out
of this.

SHERLOCK
ob, wilt 1?ea.

MYCROFT
Yes, Sherlock, you will. Now if
you'll excuse me, I have a long and
Brduous apology to make to a very old
friend,

SHERLOCK
Give her my love.

He's snatched up his violin and plays Mycroft out the door God Save The Queen.

Mycroft just rolls his eyes - when will he grow up.
We cut to just outside the window, pulling back from the

Little domestic scene inside, We can still see Sherlock
playing, still hear the music, as we dissolve &

s+. the same window, but now there are CHRISTMAS LIGHTS
around it, and maybe even a little snow drifting past. and
the violin is still playing, but it's "We Wish You A Kerry
Christmas.

 

Inside. Christmas Eve in Baker Street. MRS HUDSON is sitting
inthe chair by the fire, looking happier than we have ever
seen her. JOHN, wearing 4 SANTA HAT, is pouring her a cup of
fea and JEANETTE (a pretty woman we haven't seen before) is
serving her a TRAY OF MINCE PIES. SHERLOCK stands on the run,
serenading her with his VIOLIN.

He comes to the end with an elaborate flourish and a deep
bow.

ms HUDSON
oh, that was lovely, Sherlock, just
lovely. But I wish you'd worn the
antlers.

SHERLOCK
Some things, Mrs. Hudson, are best
left to the imagination.

Lestrade pipes up from the kitchen - he's sitting there with
a drink, and he's probably had a few.

LESTRADE
Nah, I've got photoshop on my
computer - hours of fun after a day
of Sherlock.

JORN
veah.

(G£E Sherlock's look)
sorry.«2.

SHERLOCK
Still here, are you? I had no idea we
had so much gin. No thank you, Sarah.

He's speaking Jeanette who's offering him the tray of mince
pies. The room drops a degree.

John, appears next to Jeanette, arm round her.

ORN
He's not good at names.

SHERLOCK
No, hang on, I know this. Sarah was
the doctor one, then there was the
spotty one, the nose one, and who
came after the boring teacher?

JEANETTE
Nobody.

SHERLOCK
Jeanette! Process of elimination.

Now bustling through the doors, Molly Hooper, with big
shopping bags full of presents:

MouLY
Hello everyone, sorry, hello. It said
on the door, just to Come up.

MRS HUDSON
Molly, dear, in you come.

JORN
Hello, Molly!

SHERLOCK
(Under his breath)
oh dear Lord.

MOLLY
Are we having a Christmas drinkies
then?

SHERLOCK

There's no stopping them. Apparently.
Sherlock is now at this desk, busying himself.

MRS HUDSON
It's the one day a year the boys have
to be nice tome, It's almost worth
at.

SHERLOCK
John, this counter's stuck.

SHERLOCK (cont'd)
(He's pointing to John's Laptop)
on your biog, it's still 1895.

JOHN

oh no - Christmas is cancelled.
SHERLOCK

And you've got a photograph of me in

that hat!

on John's laptop screen, a photo of Sherlock in the
deerstalker ~ illustrating a story called "The Six
hatchers.

ORM
People like the hat.

SHERLOCK
No they don't, What people?

MOLLY
How's the hip?

MRS HUDSON
Atrocious, thanks for asking.

MOLLY
oh, I've seen worse. But then, 1 do

Oh God, sorry, T just - ob!

SHERLOCK
Don't make jokes, Molly.
MOLLY

LESTRADE

Hello, Moll.

MouLY
ob, hello, Detective Inspector - I
thought you were going to Dorset for
Christmas.

LESTRADE
First thing tomorrow, me and the
wife. Back together, all sorted.

SHERLOCK
No. She's sleeping with a PE teacher.

MOLLY
and John, I hear you're off to
your sister's, is that right?
Sherlock was complaining. Saying.6

JOHN
First time ever. She's cleaned up her
act, she's off the booze.

SHERLOCK

No.

OHM
shut up, Sherlock.

 

SHERLOCK
I see you've got a new boyfriend,
Molly, and you're serious about him.

Molly: instantly blushing.

MOLLY
What? Sorry, what?

 

SHERLOCK
And in fact, you're going to see him
this very night and deliver hima
present.

ORM
oh, what would Christmas be without a
Bit of deduction!

LESTRADE
Shut up and have a drink.

SHERLOCK
But surely you've noticed the top
present in the bag
He's pointing to a splendidly wrapped present, in red
wrapping paper.

 

SHERLOCK
Perfectly wrapped, with a bow,
whereas the others are all slapdash
Bt best. It's for someone special
then, The shade of red echoes her
Lipstick - either an unconscious
association, or one she's
deliberately trying to encourage.
Either way, Miss Hooper has love on
her mind. ‘That she's serious about
him, is Clear from the fact she's
giving him a Christmas gift at all that always suggests long term hopes,
however forlorn ~ and the fact that
she's seeing him tonight is evident
from her make up and clothing. she's
obviously trying to compensate for
the size of her mouth and breasts —6s.

As he speaks he's picked up the parcel, taken a look ~

= and now freeze in the closest he gets to embarrassment. The
label says Sherlock. An aching silence.

Everyone avoiding looking at anyone - cos everyone saw this
train crash coming.

Finally

 

SHERLOCK
Thank you, Molly. This looks lovely.
How thoughtful.

on Molly. So humiliated. can't even look at him. Just gives a
Little nod. Maybe emits a tiny whimper.

SHERLOCK
I think John and I have a present for
you too.

He darts a hopeful look at John, who gives a pained little
nod.

Molly gives another little. Anywhere but here, right now,
please!!

Sherlock is about to step away. But no! He can do better!
He touches her arm.

SHERLOCK
Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper.

And he leans in and kisses her on the cheek. On John
watching - that's new! Even human!!

Sherlock straightens up from Molly, and she's all fine. shy
but so thrilled. And even attempting to raise her eyeline to
Sherlock's ... but the moment she does ~

~ an orgasmic gasp (Sherlock's phone.)

Molly's hand flies to her mouth.

MOLLY
No that wasn't ~ I didn't —

SHERLOCK
No, it's fine, it was me.

LESTRADE
My God, really?

SHERLOCK
My phone.66.

He's pulled his phone from his jacket, now looks at the text.
ON-SCREEN TEXT: Mantelpiece.

JOHN
Fifty-seven.

SHERLOCK
Sorry, what?

Sherlock is looking over at the Mantelpiece. There's a tiny
Little red parcel there, with a bow on it.

JOHN
Figty-seven of those texts - just the
ones I've heard.

SHERLOCK
How thrilling that you've counted.

Sherlock is now examining the little parcel. A bow on it.
Red. (NB. It s not identical to Molly's parcel, but clealy
the same set of impulses went into it.)

Irene's lipsticked mouth - the same shade as the

An orgasmic gasp. He checks his phone.

MycROFT

were kind enough to point out, it
hardly matters

SHERLOCK

No. T think you're going to find her
dead.

As he says this he turns to see ~
= JOHN, leaning in the doorway. Clearly been listening.
Sherlock instantly snaps the phone off, stands, looks coldly
at John. Doesn't like being interrupted.

JOHN

She winces, again giving away too much of her lonely life.
She's pulling back the sheet now.

MouLY
I'm afraid her face is a bit sort of
bashed, it might be a little bit
digescult.

Sherlock and Mycroft look coldly down. (We don't see.)

MycROFT
It's her, isn't it?

SHERLOCK
Show me the rest of her.

Molly hesitates, then pulls back the rest of the sheet.

BARTS/CORRIDOR - NIGHT

SHERLOCK, standing staring out of the window at the end of
the corridor, watching the snow fall. He doesn't look sad just faintly preoccupied.

MYCROFT appears next to him, holds up a cigarette, offering
it to him.

MYCROFT
Just the one.
SHERLOCK
why?
MYCROFT

Merry Christmas.

Sherlock smiles, takes it. Mycroft starts lighting it for
hin.

SHERLOCK
Smoking indoors. Isn't there one of
those law things?

MycROFT
We in 2 morgue ~ there's only so much
damage you can do. How did you know
she was dead?

SHERLOCK
She had an item in her possession one she told me her life depended on.
She chose to give it up.

MYCROFT
Where is this item now?

Sherlock doesn't answer. He's looking down the corridor - at
the far, three people have emerged from the mortuary. A
MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE, and an OLDER WOMAN. They're all clutching
each other, sobbing. Clearly they have also had some bad
news. A mottuary attendant stands at a respectful distance.

Sherlock regards them, clinically.

SHERLOCK
Look at them. They all care so much.
Do you ever wonder if there's
something wrong with us?

MYCROFT
All lives end, all hearts are broken.
Caring is not'an advantage, Sherlock.

what last word, just a little pointed. Like a gentle,
brotherly warning.10.

Sherlock just sucks at his cigarette. Then frowns at it.

SHERLOCK
This is low tar.

mycRoFt
Well you barely knew her.

Sherlock gives an abrupt little laugh. Then starts heading
away down the corridor. As he goes ~

SHERLOCK
Merry Christmas, Mycroft.

We hold on Mycroft, framed against the window, the snow, and
the dark, Such a cold figure.

mycROF?
And a happy new year.

As Sherlock's footsteps echo away, Mycroft already has his
phone out, dialling. Now the phone is being answered.

MycROFT
He's on his way. Have you found

JOHN sitting by the fire, Glass of brandy in hand, trying to
concentrate on a book. But really, he's waiting.

outside some drunken revellers are singing "God Rest Ye Merry
Gentlemen." Distant, lonely, eerie.

We hear the door. John looks round.

SHERLOCK, standing in the doorway, sombre. John, relieved to
see him, hiding it.

JORN
Hi. You okay?

Sherlock reflects for a moment. He scans around the room - a
forensic sweep of a look.

SHERLOCK

Hope you haven't messed up ay sock
index this time!

And we hear his bedroom door bang!
oh JOHN: damn! And over this we hear a soaring sad melody,
being played on a violin...

IND, 2218 BAKER STREET ~ DAY

SHERLOCK, in his DRESSING GOWN, is playing this sweetest
saddest tune on his VIOLIN. He’ stands at the window, focussed

on the music. JOHN is pottering about the flat - putting on
his coat, clearly about to go out.a.

MRS HUDSON is clearing away plates from where John and
Sherlock have been eating. John's plate is cleared,
Sherlock's is untouched.

Mrs Hudson pointedly shows the plate to John as she heads to
the kitchen He hasn't eaten again.

MRS HUDSON
Lovely tune. Haven't heard that one
before, Sherlock.

Sherlock stops for a moment, makes a mark on sheet of
manuscript.

ORK
Ave you composing?

SHERLOCK
Helps me think.

The sad, haunting tune continues.

JOHN
What are you thinking about?

And a discordant note from Sherlock - he throws down the
violin, strides over to where John's laptop stands open at
his deck, He's pulled from his dressing gown pocket, Irene's
leopard skin phone.

Sherlock has pulled up John's blog page. The counter still
stands at 1895.

SHERLOCK
Your blog counter - it's still stuck
at 1895.

feeling. No clue, He starts towards the stairs, passes Mrs

Black suited goons - TRANTER and a new one - standing by the
fireplace.

And now SHERLOCK comes strolling through the door, cool as
anything, hands clasped behind him, cool as anything — like
Prince Charles on an official visit.

Mrs Hudson gives a little whimper as she sees him.

SHERLOCK
Please don't snivel, Mrs. Hudson ~ it
does nothing to impede the flight of
a bullet. What a tender world that
would be:

NEILSON
I believe you have something that we
want, Mr. Holmes.

SHERLOCK
Then you should ask for it.

Sherlock has stepped forward to Mrs Hudson. Gently he pushes
one of her sleeves up - blotches on her arm. Finger marks
where she's been tightly gripped. Now his fingers go to where
there's a rip in her blouse ~ he’s almost tender. she's been
roughed up - and now she's shaking like a leaf.

NEILSON
I've been asking this one - she
doesn't seem to know anything. But
you know what I'm asking for, don't
you, Mr. Holmes?

Sherlock's gaze slams on to Neilson - a stare like cold blue
lasers.

You don't mind if 1 check?

SHERLOCK

Neilson steps forward, and with his gun still trained on him,
he starts briskly and efficiently risking with his other
hand. As he bends to his task, Sherlock helpfully raises his
hands over his head —

behind him. The SPRAY ROPTLE from Mrs Hudson's cleaning
bucket, heid in his hand.

He glances at Mrs Hudson over Neilson’s shoulder. She's seen

And from outeide, there are cheers, and fireworks going off.

under his chin, and starts to play.

the world. Not sure how that could be
true, but give mea moment, I've only
been on the case for eight seconds.

They just look at him, startled.93.

SHERLOCK
oh, come on, it's not code, these are
seat allocations on a passenger jet.
Look! “There are no letters past J ~
the width of the plane is the limit.
The nunbers only appear singly and
never in sequence, but the letters
have little runs of sequence all over
place - families and couples sitting
Eogether. Only a Jumbo is wide enough
to need a letter J, or rows past 55,
which always require an upstairs
Section. There's a row 13, 0 we can
eliminate the more superstitious
airlines. The style of the flight
Aunber - 007 ~ eliminates a few more,
and assuming a British point of
Origin, which would be logical given
the original source of the
information, and assuming from the
increased pressure on you lately,
that the crisis is inminent, the’ only
flight which matches all the criteria
and departs within a week, is the
6.30 to LA tomorrow evening, from
Gatwick airport.

Again just silence. That was alarming fast and clever. For
the first time, Irene is just staring at him in a general
state of wow!

SHERLOCK
Please don't feel obliged to tell me
that was remarkable or amazing. John
has expressed that thought in every
possible variant available to the
English language.

IRENE ADLER
I would have you, on this desk, right
now, till you begged for mercy,
twice.

SHERLOCK

seteseses-John, could you check
those flight schedules, see if 1'm
right?

JORN
yeah, right, on it, yeah.

 

He potters at a computer. Grateful to be out of the

Sherlock looks back at Irene, still that roasting stare from
a bit too close, He makes a modest flail for dignity.94.

SHERLOCK
Never begged for mercy in my life.
IRENE ADLER

JOHN
Yep, you're right - 007, licensed to
fly:

on Sherlock - the words impact on him.

SHERLOCK
What did you say??

JOHN
I said, you're right.

SHERLOCK
No, after that, what did you say
after that??

ORM
007, licensed to fly. Sorry.

Sherlock distracted now, moving avay - something haunting
him, chining in his head.

on Irene, watching him, apparently worried ~
= but the camera swoops down behind her, closing on one hand
held slightly behind her. She has her phone in her hand and
is rapidly thumbing a text.

The words now running across the screen:

747 TOMORROW 6.30PM. GATWICK.

The words keep typing as the picture behind them dissolves
tor

EXT, WESTMINSTER BRIDGE ~ DAY

From behind, a MAN heading along. As the words complete,
there is the beep of a text arriving. The man stops walking,
pulls out his mobile phone, looks at it

MORIARTY! He reads the text in mounting joy. A mad,
spreading, grin.

INT, 2218 BAKER STREET - DAY

 

On Sherlock, pacing now, bit frantic, trying to reach for
something95.

SHERLOCK
Licensed to fly, licensed to fly!
(laps his head)
There's something! What? what?
EXT, WESTMINSTER BRIDGE - DAY
JIM MORIARTY, rapidly texting away.
ON-SCREEN TEXT: Jumbo jet. Dear me, Mr. Holmes, dear me.
As Jim, he giggles happily, childichly. He glances up a Big

Then it hits him like a physical impact.

racking in on Sherlock's bemused face. What? What??

IND, MvcROFT'S STUDY - DAY

A blackberry on a leather-topped desk. It buzzes, a text
arriving. A hand reaches in, picks it up to read.

ON-SCREEN TEXT: Jumbo jet. Dear me, Mr . Holmes, dear me.
And the camera moves to reveal = Mycroft staring at the text in mounting horror.

We're pulling back from now, a smaller and smaller figure.
He's just received the worst news in the world. Dissolve to:

The sane pulling back shot, but now Mycroft is sitting in his
leather armchair, stricken“faced, 2 brandy in his hand.

The same pulling back shot. Mycroft, sitting in the chair,
his head held in his hands. How the hell is he going to deal
with this one.96.

INT, 2218 BAKER STREET - NIGHT

 

SHERLOCK sprawled in his armchair, plucking listlessly at his
violin - the same sad tune he composed eariier, but he’s
probably unaware of that. Deep, deep, in thought.

Flashback.

MYCROFT
Bond Air is go, that's decided ~
check with the Coventry lot. Tale

Sherlock frowning, distracted. Blinks, rewinds.

IRENE ADLER

Never been, is it nice?
Sherlock looks up a little startled.

SHERLOCK
Where's John?

IRENE ADLER
He went out - couple of hours ago.

SHERLOCK
But Twas just talking to him.

IRENE ADLER
He said you'd do that. What's
Coventry got to do with anything?

SHERLOCK
There's a story - possibly not true.
In the second world war, the allies
knew Coventry was going to be

bombed ~ because they'd broken the
Germans code. But they didn't want
the Germans to know they'd broken it,
50 they let the bombing happen

IRENE ADLER
Have you ever had anyone?97.

 

SHERLOCK
i'm sorry?
IRENE ADLER
And when I say "had", I'm being
indelicate.
SHERLOCK
1 don't understand.
IRENE ADLER
E/11 be delicate then. Let's have
dinner.
SHERLOCK
Way?
IRENE ADLER
You might be hungry.
SHERLOCK
I'm not.
IRENE ADLER
Goa.

She's kneeling by him now, taking his hand. (We note that he
Seems to reciprocate slightly, but a little clumsily.)

SHERLOCK
Why would T want to have dinner, if 1
wasn't bungry?

She's leaning in close to him - studying his face, hungrily.
He's equally fascinated, maybe a bit more forensic.

IRENE ADLER
Me. Holmes ... if it was end of the
world, if this was the very last

night’... would you have dinner with

on Sherlock, puzzled. Then there’s a knock at the door.

RS HUDSON
(From off)
Sherlock?
IRENE ADLER
roo late.
SHERLOCK

That's not the end of the world,
that's Mrs Hudson.

She gives the saddest look, like she knows he's wrong, and
moves away from him.se.

The door is opening - MRS HUDSON. Behind her we can see
PLUMMER - the man who first took Sherlock to Buckingham
Palace.

ms HUDSON
Sherlock, this man was at the door ig the bell still not working?

(Zo PLUMMER)
He shot it.

Plummer is already entering the room.

SHERLOCK
Are you taking me away again.
PLUMMER
Yes, Mr. Holmes.
SHERLOCK
1 decline.
PLUMMER

I don't think you do.

And Plummer has taken a long envelope from inside his jacket,
now passes it to Sherlock.

A puzzled Sherlock slits it open - and falling into his hand

a boarding pass. Flight 007 to LA, 18.30.

He stares at it. what??

EXT, BAKER STREET — NIGHT

SHERLOCK again climbing into the back of a big black car PLUMMER now climbing in next to hin.

The car starts to pull away. We pan up to IRENE ADLER,
standing at the window, watching it go.

 

INT, BIG BLACK CAR - NIGHT

 

PLUMMER and SHERLOCK in the back. The street lights flashing
across their faces. A silence. Then.

SHERLOCK
There's going to be a bomb on a
passenger jet. And the British and
American governments know about it.
And rather than expose the source of
their information they're going to
let the plane blow up:

(wore)98.

SHERLOCK (cont'd)
Coventry all over again. The wheel
turns, nothing is ever new.

PLUMMER
I read that blog your friend
weites about you.

 

SHERLOCK
And?

PLUMMER
And I didn't expect you to be an
idiot.

Silence resumes. Sherlock - just the trace of a frown.
Something's not good here.

Sherlock's POV. Lights and signs speeding past - we're
turning towards Gatwick.

EXT, AIRPORT ~ NIGHT

We're on a remote part of the airfield. A Jummo JEP standing
by a HANGER. The passenger staircase is in place.

The BIG BLACK CAR goes gliding up. Stops next to it. as
Sherlock climbs out he sees —

NEILSON and his TWO AMERICAN AGENTS standing at the foot of
the steps, like they're there to guide him on to the plane.

Sherlock, walking over to them now.

SHERLOCK
(To NEIESON)

Well you're looking all better. How

are you feeling?

NEILSON
Like putting a bullet in your brain,

He gestures to the steps, for Sherlock to ascend. sherlock
Starts heading up.

NEILSON
they'd pin a medal on me, if 1 did.
sir.

Sherlock just stops for a moment, registering that. Then

carries on up the steps.

IND, guMBO ~ NrgHT

 

Sherlock, leoking around.100.

The interior of the plane is darkened, creepy. The only light
from the portholes.

As Sherlock's eyes adjust to the gloom, he realises he's not
alone...

ss: all the seats are occupied. still, motionless figures,
Sitting and slumped. Sherlock steps closer to one of them ~
€licks on the overhead light. And there, in the little
Spotlight, is a a DEAD MAN.

He clicks on another light. A DEAD WOMAN.

Another light. Yet another DEAD PASSENGER.

on Sherlock: even for him, a neck-prickling realisation.
Everyone on this plane dead. A passenger manifest of corpses.

 

And then, impossible - a light nearer the front of the plane
seens to click on by itself. And there's a familiar voice.

MYCROFT
The Coventry conundrum. What do you
think of my solution?

And now a figure is rising from one the front seats, turn to
face him. Mycroft.

MYCROFT
The flight of the dead.

Sherlock, looking around, collecting himself, regaining his
cool.

SHERLOCK

the plane blows up in mid-air,

mission accomplished for the

terrorists, hundreds of casualties
‘and nobody dies.

 

mycROFr
Neat, don't you think? You've been
stumbling round the fringes of this
one for ages — of were you too bored
fo notice the pattern.

on Sherlock blinking, remembering

FLASHBACK: The two little girls squeezed into the client
chair.101.

LITTLE GIRL
They wouldn't let us see Grandad when
he was dead ~

Back on the plane:

MYCROFT
We ran a similar project with the
Germans a while back ~ though I
understand one of our passengers
didn't make the light ~

FLASHBACK: Sherlock examining the inexplicable body in the
boot of the car.

MYCROFT
But that's the deceased for you late in every sense of the word.

SHERLOCK
How does the plane fly? of course,
unmanned aircraft, hardly new ~

MycROFT
It doesn't fly, it will never fly.
This entire project is cancelled. The
terrorist cells have been informed
that we know about the bomb ~ we
can't fool them now. We have lost
everything. One fragment of one
email - and months and years of
planning are finished.

MycROFt
what's all it takes. One lonely,
naive man, desperate to show off, and

feel special...

You should screen your defence people
more carefully...

I'm not talking about the MoD man,
Sherlock, I'm talking about you!

on Sherlock. Rocked by that. No.

MYCROFT
A dansel in distress. In the end, are
you really so obvious? Give him love,
Yake it away, give him a puzzle, make
him dance...102.

SHERLOCK
Don't be absurd!

MycROFT
Absurd? How quickly did you decipher
that email for her - the full minute,
or were you really trying to impress?

IRENE ADLER
(From)

I think it was less than five

seconds.

Sherlock looks round. There's IRENE, standing at the entrance
to first class, NEILSON stands behind her, clearly has just
shown her up. She's still wearing Sherlock's dressing gown,
looks casual, relaxed.

Sherlock staring at her - guarded, unsure. Mycroft, genuinely
penitent.

MYCROFT
And I drove you into her path. I'm
sorry, I didn't know.

IRENE ADLER
Me. Holmes, I think we need to talk.

Sherlock, now striding towards her. Casual and assured now,
back to his old stuff.

SHERLOCK
I think so too, There are a number of
aspects i'm still not completely
clear on

IRENE ADLER
Not you, junior, you're done now.

And she simply walks past him, goes to Mycroft. She produces
her leopard skin cameraphone, tosses it in her hand.

IRENE. ADLER
There's more ~ loads more. And if you
Like, I'll keep on proving that. You
have'no idea how much havoc I can
cause, and exactly one way to stop

on Mycroft. No answer. Because she's right.

IND, MYCROFT's STUDY - NIGHT

MYCROF? at his desk. On the table in front of him, the
leopard skin camera-phone. Opposite is IRENE.103.

Standing with his back to them both, SHERLOCK looking out
into the night - a brooding, silent presence.

Mycroft prods the phone with his finger.

MYCROFT
We have people who can get into this.

IRENE ADLER
I tested that theory for you - 1 let
Sherlock Holmes try for six months
Sherlock, dear, tell him what you
found when you' x-rayed my camera
phone.

 

Sherlock doesn't turn, just speaks from where he's standing.

SHERLOCK
There are four additional unite wired
into the casing - I suspect
Containing acid or a small amount of
explosive, Any attempt to open the
casing, will burn the hard drive.

IRENE ADLER
Explosive. It's more me.

MYCROFT
Some data is always recoverable.

IRENE ADLER
wake that risk then.

MycROFT
you have a passcode to open this.
I deeply regret to say, we have
people who can extract it from you.

 

IRENE ADLER
Sherlock?

SHERLOCK
There will he two codes. One to open
the phone, one to burn the drive.
Even under duress, you can't know
which one she's given you. And there
Would be no point in a second
attempt.

IRENE ADLER
oh, isn't he good. I should have him
on'a leash. In fact, 1 might.

mycROFT

We destroy this then. No one has the
ingormation.104.

IRENE ADLER
Fine, good idea. Unless there are
Lives of British citizens depending
on the information you're about to
burn.

 

MYCROFT
Ave there?

IRENE ADLER
welling you, would be playing fair.
I'm not playing any more.

She's tossed him an envelope across the desk to Mycroft.

IRENE ADLER
A list of requests, and some ideas
about my protection once they're
granted.

Mycroft has slit open the envelope, glanced at the single
sheet.

IRENE ADLER
I'd say it wouldn't blow much of a
hole in the wealth of a nation, but
I'd be lying. I imagine you'd like to
sleep on it.

MYCROFT
Thank you, yes.

IRENE ADLER
Too bad. Off you pop and talk to

people.

He looks at her. A grim moment - total defeat. A polite
Little bow of his head.

MYCROFT
You've been very ... thorough. 1 wish
our lot were half as good as you.

IRENE ADLER
can't take all the credit. Got a bit
of help. Jim Moriarty sends his love.

On Sherlock's back - stiffening. On Mycroft, a sober note.

MycROFT

be desperate for my attention.
(Wakes a note)

Which I'm sure can be arranged.108.

IRENE ADLER

He starts

SHERLOCK
(Still without turning)
No.

IRENE ADLER

turning now. Quite his old self, cold as ice.

SHERLOCK
I said, no. Very, very close, but no.
You got carried away, the game was
far too elaborate - you enjoyed
yourself too much.

IRENE ADLER
There's no such thing as too much.

SHERLOCK
Enjoying thrill of the chase is fine.
Craving the distraction of the game —
I entirely sympathise. But sentiment?
Sentiment is a chemical defect found
in the losing side.

IRENE ADLER
Sentiment? What are you talking
about?

SHERLOCK

vou.106.

IRENE ADLER
Oh dear God, look at the poor man.
You don't think 1 was actually
interested in you? Why? Because
you're the great Sherlock Holmes? The
Glever detective with the funny hat?

SHERLOCK
No. Because I took your pulse.

FLASHBACK: in 2218, Irene taking Sherlock's hand, Sherlock
clunsily reciprocating - but actually taking her pulse.

SHERLOCK
Elevated. Your pupils dilated.

FLASHBACK: Irene studying his face hungrily. Sherlock
staring, back forensic. Closer now on ner dilating pupil.

SHERLOCK
I imagine John Watson thinks love is
a mystery to me. But the chemistry is
terribly simple. And very
destructive.

He's walking round the desk - in swanning about, explaining
mode. He picks up her canera-phone.

on Irene - just the first uncertainty. Is she in trouble now?

SHERLOCK
You told me, when we first met, that
@isguise is’ always a self-portrait.
How true of you. The combination of
your safe - your measurements. But
this —

(fosses the camera-phone in his hand)
his is more intimate. It's your
heart. And you should never let it
rule your head.

number and you'd have walked away
today, with everything you worked
for.

you? I've always assumed that love
was a dangerous disadvantage 
(Beep)
thank you for the final proof.

He holds the phone out to her, displaying the screen.

Irene, rocked already, just stares at it. Everything is lost.
Maybe there's even a tear in her eye, as she looks up at him.107.

IRENE ADLER
Everything I said tonight — it wasn't
real. Tt was just playing the game.

SHERLOCK
I know. And this is just losing.

SHERLOCK
And so you are.

He tosses it to Mycroft.

SHERLOCK
There you go, brother. I hope the
contents make up for any
inconvenience I've caused you this
evening.

Mycroft, benusedly staring at the phone. He's pleased at the
victory, but just a little chilled at how Sherlock won.

MYCROFT
i'm certain they will...

SHERLOCK
If you're feeling kind, lock her up.
Tf not, let her go. 1 doubt she'll
last long without her protection.

IRENE ADLER
Are you expecting me to beg?

SHERLOCK
ves.

He turns, heading to the door, almost gets there 
IRENE ADLER
Please.

He looks round. she's standing now - so vulnerable. Pleading.
IRENE ADLER

You're right. I won't last six
months. Please.108.

Pushing in Sherlock now - that cold, cruel face.

SHERLOCK
Sorry about dinner.

And he goes, closing the door behind him. And slowly we fade
£0 black.

EXT, BAKER STREET — DAY

It's winter again - and raining like hell: a day for terrible
news. JOHN ie dashing along through the downpour. He stops as
he sees an unfamiliar sight.

MYCROF?, leaning against the wall, outside Speedy's. He's
under shelter of the awning and smoking. He has big ziplock
file under his arm. John approaches.

JOHN
You don't smoke.

I also don't frequent cafes.

He turns and heads into Speedy's, clearly expecting John to
follow.

IND, SPEEDY'S CAPE ~ DAY

MYCROFT and JOHN, sitting across the table from each other,
with coffees. Silence for a moment - just the hise of the
rain outside, the under-sea gloom of the cafe, the soaking
wet coats of the customers.

SHERLOCK at the kitchen table. He's at his microscope

his hand.

The rain is streaming down the windows, casting shadowpatterns all over the walls. The little flat has never looked
50 gloomy.

SHERLOCK

Clearly you have news. If it's about

that triple murder in Leeds, it was

the gardener. Did nobody notice his

earring?
JOHN

Hi. No, it's ... it s about Irene

Adler.

And Sherlock looks up, instantly interested. on John,
registering this.

SHERLOCK
Well? Has something happened? Has she
turned up again?

JOHN
No. No, she's ... I just bumped into
Mycroft downstairs, he had to take a
call ss

SHERLOCK

Is she back in London?

And he's on his feet. He's come over to John. He's just that
Litele bit too interested.

JORN
No. She's tsaa.

And he's looking hard at Sherlock. And Sherlock is looking a
bit too hard at him. And John makes the fateful decision.

Yeah. She's gone into a witness
protection scheme, apparently. Don't

Well. You won't able to see her

Why would I'want to see her again?

JOHN
Didn't say you did.

SHERLOCK
Is that her file?

ORM
Yeah - got to take it back to
Mycroft. Do you ... want a look at

SHERLOCK
No.

Sherlock has gone back to his microscope.
Oh John: has he misjudged. should he have told him,

JOHN
Listen, actually 
SHERLOCK

oh, but I'll have the camera-phone.

He puts his hand out for it.

There's nothing on it any more. It
was all stripped off.a2.

SHERLOCK
1 know, But I'll have it.

JOHN
No, it has to go back to Mycroft. You
can't keep this.

Sherlock doesn't reply, or even look at him. Just continues
fo hold his hand out.

ORM
Sherlock, I have to take this back.
It's government property now, it's —

SHERLOCK
Please.

Still hasn't looked round, still hasn't registered any

GROPTY LITTLE ROOM/ISLAMABAD

IRENE, on her last day, kneeling in the centre of a room,
surrounded by MASKED AND ROBED TERRORISTS.

Irene is calm, serene - and sending one last text. she now
hands her phone to one of the terrorists, and we cee her say
"Ghankyou". Her EXECUTIONER is stepping up behind her now,
ewinging back with his long aword.

Closer on Irene now, as she straightens her neck and prepares
herself for the end. So sad, so full of regrets. she slowly
closes her eyes.

And as her eyes close, the screen fades into darkness.

We hold the darkness for a long final moment, like the movie
really is over. Then:

‘An ORGASMIC GASP. A text has arrived!

on Irene as her eyes fly open again. What? Where did that
come from??

The terrorists all looking at each other now. what??

But Irene is looking up at her tall, thin executioner. The
face is covered but the voice is familiar.

SHERLOCK
When I say run, run!

on Irene - her face breaks into a delighted, incredulous
grin.

INT, 2218 BAKER STREET ~ DAY

 

And now the same grin on Sherlock's face, remembering that
day. He laughs! Fooled then all again! He pulls the leopard
skin camera-phone from his pocket, tosses it in his hand.

SHERLOCK

(s a sort of salute)
‘The Woman!

He takes the camera-phone, opens his desk drawer, drops it
inside. Looks at it lying’ there for moment.aaa.

SHERLOCK

(wore fondly)
‘The Woman.

on his face, clear moment of warmth - remembering the long
contest, that remarkable woman, the year of Irene Adler.

when he closes the drawer, It's almost ceremonial - like he's
putting something away. Then the warmth just drops from his
face, and he's Sherlock Holmes again.

We hold the closed drawer big in the foreground as he turns
and walks away ~ back to his microscope, back to work...
