Act ONE

WE. SCHOOL - DAY

MORTY is walking through the halls of the school with other
students. We hear PRINCIPAL VAGINA over the loud speaker.

PRINCIPAL VAGINA (0.5.)
Principal Vagina here, don’t let
‘the name fool you, I'm very much in
charge, reminding you that tonight
ig our’ annual £1u season dance.

Morty gets to his locker. He looks down the hall at JESSICA,
who is standing with her friends.

PRINCIPAL VAGINA (0.5.) (CONT‘D)
I don’t know how many times I have

to say this, but if you have the

flu, stay home. The flu season

dange is about awareness, noe

celebration. You don't bring dead

babies to Passover.

 

Morty takes a deep breath and heads over to Jessica.

MoRTY
E-hey Jessica, um...

JESSICA

What's up Morty?
Jessica sneezes delicately as BRAD (the jock) comes up and
enube Morty.

 

BRAD

JERRY
Tey not to worry about it, Morty.
You're a good kid. And there's aot
a premium on that right now but
you'll be getting girls some tine
After Brad's out of shape.

MORTY
You're missing the point, Dad. I
don't want girls. I want Jessica.

Jerzy takes his attention off the sandwich and locks Morty in
the eye.

TERRY
My marriage is fine, thank you!

Rick gets ice from the fridge.

RICK
Jerry, it's your house, whatever
you say is how it is, but I think a
Elind man could see Beth is looking
for the door. I barely have a
reason to care and even I noticed.

ory
Bey, Rick! Don’t talk about my
parents like that!

Rick grabs the 0.J. and pours it in his glass

RICK
Listen, Morty. I hate to break it
fo you, but what people call “love”
is Just a chemical reaction that
compels animals to breed. Tt hits
hard, then slowly fades, leaving
you stranded in a failing marriage.
I did it. Your parents are doing
it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise
above it. Focus on science.

Rick leaves the 0.J. out and exite with his drink. Morty and
Jerry are left in sad silence.

Brad grabs his head. He appears dazed for a monent, then his
